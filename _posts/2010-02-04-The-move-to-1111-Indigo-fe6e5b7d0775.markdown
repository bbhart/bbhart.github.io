By this time next week, our move will be done and we’ll have spent our first night in our new house.

The closing is all set for Monday morning at 8:30am, so by 9:15 or so we’ll be homeowners once more. We’ve received the final HUD-1 — approved by our lender — and will venture to the Bank of America tomorrow for a large-ish bank check.

None of it seems real, since it’s been six-and-a-half months since we made our offer. We haven’t packed the first thing, though I’ve been responsible enough to arrange for electricity, cable, and Internet at the new place, plus a truck to move there with. It’s not quite as large a move as our last one. When we moved from Pennsylvania, we were condensing four bedroom plus a cluttered basement into a 3 bedroom plus garage. This time we’re going from 3 bedroom to 3 bedroom (but with 400 more square feet), and since we’re not using a van line, we can be sloppier about how we pack. For example, on Monday we can throw a bunch of kitchen stuff in the car and take it right over there. It’s only ~7 houses away, after all, so this may be the easiest moves I’ve done.
