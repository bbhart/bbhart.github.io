At the Garmisch station, the train crew realized the train would be overcrowded and called for additional cars, delaying our departure by 10 minutes. In the 1st class car with us was a woman who worked for a university (I didn't catch which one). She proactively told us what was up with the delay, which was nice. She was connecting onward in Munich, and said she always books extra time with connections due to frequent delays. Switzerland would _never_. 

The whole trip was maybe an hour and a half, not a big deal for us given the longer train days we've had on this trip. The [Munich train station](https://www.bahnhof.de/en/muenchen-hbf) was **bustling**. There was construction in progress and nonexistent signage (in _any_ language) for finding the exit. I just headed east and looked for sunlight.

Rowan was not impressed with how busy the city was. It was his first real big city experience.

Neues Rathaus at Marienplatz:

The famous Rathaus Glockenspiel:

For the afternoon Rowan wanted to hang in the room so I headed out to explore the famous [English garden](https://www.muenchen.de/en/sights/attractions/english-garden) and definitely get my steps for the day.

Bavarian State Chancellery building:

If you watch any Munich shorts you'll eventually see these falls:

Dinner was at an [Kilians Irish pub](https://kiliansirishpub.de/) where they also had a separate Australian pub. We managed to get in and fed before the cutoff for Rowan being underage. While we were able to grab 2 seats at the bar at 8:15 pretty easily, the whole room was really busy by 9.

And here's my CPAP water for this city:

My overall feeling from the day is that Munich would be an incredible place to be a 20-something year old.
