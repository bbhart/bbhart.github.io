Today is Friday and the cruise is on Sunday. We'll spend two nights in Jersey City, giving us a full day on Saturday to tour around New York City.

We're mostly packed and ready to head to the airport in 3 hours. Oh, as I was hopping out of the shower I saw a new text on my phone:

Well that's certainly unfortunate.

Any other reasonable flights today on Delta? No.
Any other reasonable flights today on any airline into Newark? No.
Any other reasonable flights today into any of the 3 NYC airports today? No.

Our first instinct was to plan to drive from RDU to Jersey City instead. I even made a reservation at Avis. On further consideration, our leaving the Raleigh area at 2pm would put us driving up the eastern seaboard on a Friday afternoon with severe weather in the area. Given we still had a solid 48 hours to make it to the ship in Bayonne, NJ, I opted for a 7am United flight the next morning. We'll keep driving as a last resort for now.

So much for day 1.
