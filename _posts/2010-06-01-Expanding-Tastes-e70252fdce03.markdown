I like more kinds of food now than I did in the past. Why is that?

When I was growing up(\*), I wouldn’t eat:

*   Squash or zucchini
*   Mushrooms
*   Asparagus

My, how the times have changed. For whatever reason, I am hopelessly in love with mushrooms and asparagus. I buy asparagus at the [Celebration Farmers Market](http://celebrationblog.com/217/views-from-the-farmers-market/) almost every week and either grill it or roast it. For the mushrooms, they are purchased weekly, as well, and make their way into either homemade spaghetti sauce, caramelized onions & mushrooms for steak topping, chicken marsala, or whatever else I can work them in to. The mushroom smell as they start to cook is music to my nose. Squash & zucchini… well, I don’t seek it out… but I certainly don’t abhor it like I did before.

So what changed? I can’t rightly say. I don’t _think_ I was simply being difficult before. That takes a lot of work, and honestly… who has the energy? I truly think my palate has adapted to more foods. This leaves me wondering what I’m consciously or subconsciously avoiding because I didn’t like it when I was 5 years old.

Yes, I’ve tried oysters recently… and yes, they still taste like sand and death. And don’t even get me started on soapy cilantro.
