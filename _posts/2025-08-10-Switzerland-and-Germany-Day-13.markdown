Today we'd have our first experience with [Munich's U-Bahn rail system](https://www.introducingmunich.com/u-bahn) to reach [BMW Welt](https://www.bmw-welt.com/en/index.html), a _"combined exhibition, delivery, adventure museum, and event venue located in Munich's district Am Riesenfeld, next to the Olympic Park, in the immediate vicinity of the BMW Headquarters and factory."_[^1] I had to search up a description because I don't know quite how to describe it, even after visiting. It seemed like a really neat place to take delivery of a new BMW or to attend a swishy cocktail party, neither of which were on our itineraries. Still, we had a nice time here walking around, checking out a variety of BMW models, and people-watching.

We had food truck hot dog and fries outside, walked through the [Olympic Park](https://www.olympiapark.de/en), then made our way back to [Marienplatz](https://www.munich.travel/en/pois/urban-districts/marienplatz). It's Sunday in Germany, so lots of stores and restaurants are closed. We contented ourselves with walking around and exploring some but didn't do anything notable.

In evening we dined outside in the courtyard at the [Ratskeller restaurant in Neues Rathaus](https://www.ratskeller.com/files/downloads/english/restaurant-ratskeller.html) to celebrate a special occasion.

After dinner I wanted to show Rowan the English Garden, where there were still a lot of people walking about but nobody lounging, unlike the festival atmosphere of the day before. Still, we had a great walk and talk, and managed to get our steps in.

Tonight will be our last night in downtown Munich.
