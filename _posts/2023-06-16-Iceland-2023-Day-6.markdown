## Horses!

We went to [Sturlureykir Horse Farm](https://www.west.is/en/service/sturlureykirhorses-visiting-horsefarm) near the northern Reykholt[^1], and me and Siena rode horses! Siena was all grins from the moment we went into the stable to pick our horses, until the end when we were back to the barn.

## Hot springs and hot dogs

Since we were in the area, we went to [Deildartunguhver](https://guidetoiceland.is/travel-iceland/drive/deildartunguhver) (next to [Krauma](https://www.krauma.is/en), which I had previously staked out), which was steamy.

I had my first (and only, so far) Icelandic hot dog and it was much better than I could've expected… to the point where I want them all the time now. The crunchy onions really make it.

After that we stopped by Reykholt and checked out an old stone house and cemetery.

## Back to Húsafell

Then finally back to Husafell, where we stopped by the Bistro again, this time me getting the buffet (which was… not good), and the other three splitting the meat lovers pizza (which was quite good). Live and learn.

Since we were into the weekend now, Friday night and all, the campground was hopping… lots of activity there, plus lots of kids around at the jump pillow. Rowan begged to go back over there at 10:30pm, but honestly… I was done. It was a busy day!

Here are some photos of the cottage itself.

**Footnotes**

[^1]: I say 'the northern Reykholt' because there are two, both are near tourist areas, and it's possible to be confused. Something to note!
