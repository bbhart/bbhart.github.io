Today's the first of two sea days between St. John's and Greenland. 

The water today has an odd look to it, like it's simulated. Maybe it is. Maybe all of this is!

Temperatures have dropped since yesterday, with temps in the low 50's. The days of mid-70's are behind us now that we're heading mostly north toward Greenland. Seas are relatively calm today. The captain has already warned of stronger winds (25-30 kts out of the west) and rougher seas (6-8 feet) tomorrow. 

We're around 1/3 of the way there:

We learned today from the Captain's announcement that after we leave Akureyri, Iceland, we'll briefly head north and cross the Arctic Circle. He kind of made this sound like a big deal that had been planned as a favor based on passenger request... but the Arctic Circle is only 100 miles north of Akureyri, and we typically sail at least a few dozen miles off the coast anyway, so I'm not buying that it was some special accommodation. Regardless: pretty cool.

In the evening we left the kids to their own devices (figuratively) and went to the Tuscan Grille specialty restaurant. We had an excellent view of the back of the ship as we made our way through the Labrador Sea. Food quality was definitely a step up from the main dining room, though still a step behind what you'd find at a higher end Italian restaurant. 

Once back in the room we found out the kids had decided to go to the main dining by themselves, though 20 minutes late. Oh, and they finally -- here on day 8 -- managed to make some friends from the Teen Lounge that we've been pushing them to visit since the first few hours of being onboard. They stayed out to past midnight playing ship-wide Hide & Seek. 

Despite being a bit beyond 56 degrees northern latitude, it ended up being a nice weather day. On our western-facing balcony, with the ship blocking the wind, it was shorts weather in the afternoon.
