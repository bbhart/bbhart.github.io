# Japan trip days 8, 9, and 10
 
**Kyoto**

 I took the Shinkansen high speed train from Yokohama station to Kyoto’s central station. The Shinkansen experience will get its own post. 
 When planning my trip, I waffled a lot on where to stay in Kyoto. Do I want to be on the fringes of the city in a residential neighborhood? Might I want to try to stay in a ryokan, which is a traditional Japanese style inn with tatami floors and communal baths? If I stay over here in 
this
 hotel, do I want to then spend an hour on transit getting to 
these
 tourist attractions? Etc. 
 I ended up staying at the Kyoto train station at 
Hotel Granvia Kyoto
. Being above the train station meant I’d be more centrally located for getting around, and there was an extensive mall complex wrapped through the station which was convenient for finding food or even just killing time walking around out of the cold. 
 After getting checked in and settled, I grabbed a late lunch in the mall downstairs.

 The next morning I set out walking north from the hotel intending to check out Nijo-jo Castle and Kyoto Imperial Palace. It was a healthy 3.6km walk to Nijo-jo.

**Within Nijo-jo Castle**

 Kamakura was where I first started to feel more at ease with being in Japan, and that feeling continued within the walls of Nijo-jo here in Kyoto. I consciously made myself be present here. Yes, I had my phone out some to take photos, but I also focused on mindfulness while walking the grounds. I took the time to read signs, breathe in the air, reflect, and find gratitude in being able to have this experience.

The grounds of Nijo-jo

From here Kyoto Imperial Palace is a relatively short 1.4km walk. I made my way from the south entrance to the grounds north toward the Palace but about half way there I hit a (metaphorical) wall. I was cold, tired of walking, and rain was threatening. I subway’d back home to the Kyoto train station, then hit the mall underneath for tonkatsu. I’m pretty sure I didn’t eat it right.

**Kiyomizu-dera**

 The next morning I made an early start to see Kiyomizu-dera before the crowds hit this popular tourist spot.

On the walk back to the train station I spotted this good boy basking in the sun.

This was my last night in Kyoto and in Japan. I finished the day with some shopping and a 7-Eleven meal. 

Tomorrow I take the bullet train to Shinagawa station and then a local to Haneda airport. It will be a day of travel. 

For next time in Kyoto I would want to stay in a different, less urban part of the city. I’d like to get the feel for a Kyoto neighborhood, versus the built-up area around the main train station. I’d also plan to visit Osaka (probably as a day trip) and Nara Park.
