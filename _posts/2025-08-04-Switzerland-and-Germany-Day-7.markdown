- **Start of day:** Zermatt, Switzerland
- **End of day:** Appenzell, Switzerland

This was our first of two truly long train days. I'm not even counting the Zurich->Wengen or Wengen->Zermatt days.

We took the 8:37am train out of Zermatt[^1], made a bunch of transfers, and finally made it to Appenzell around 2pm. 

From the train station we had a short 8 minute, mostly downhill, walk to our hotel. Amenity-wise, the [Adler Hotel](https://www.adlerhotel.ch/en/home/) in Appenzell was a step down from the Albatros in Zermatt, but both of us agreed that we didn't really mind. It was a decent location and had a balcony for me to read while Rowan gamed with friends. It was near the high street of Appenzell where the restaurants and shops are. The hotel restaurant was closed for a few days; the hotel overall probably would've felt more lively if it had been open.

What started as a gray day started to clear late afternoon and the beauty of the surrounding area started to grow on me. Appenzell was planned simply as a midpoint to break up what would've been a 9+ hour train day as we transited from Zermatt to Füssen, but now I think I would return and try to do some activities in the area. I mean, look at this!

Having more time, I would take the ~17 minute train to [Wasserauen](https://www.ebenalp.ch/en/welcome) and then take the lift up. I might even consider staying at the [Aescher Inn](https://aescher.ch/en/) [(photo)](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Category:Aescher#/media/File:Aescher-Wildkirchli_20210528_01.jpg), the very Instagrammable hotel/restaurant built into a cliff, but that would need to be a backpack not rolling-suitcase trip.

We walked up and down the main street and finally ate at [Café-Hotel Appenzell](https://www.hotel-appenzell.ch/en/home.html), where we both enjoyed the weinerschnitzel (not pictured) and fries.

Here are some other views from around central Appenzell:

After dinner we wandered down to the supermarket for some snack provisions for the trains tomorrow, including my favorite:

Tomorrow: what else? More trains.

**Footnotes:**

[^1]: We actually had to scurry for this. We'd planned to talk it but upon trying to check out we discovered the reception person was running an errand and we couldn't check out. This 10 minute hiccup would've messed us up but they were nice enough to run us down to the station after helping us settle the bill.
