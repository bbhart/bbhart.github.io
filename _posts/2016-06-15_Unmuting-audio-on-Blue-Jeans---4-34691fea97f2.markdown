It’s: **\*4 — unmute audio**

This is exceptionally difficult for me to find on [Blue Jeans’ bizarre support site](https://bluejeans.com/support) (I ended up finding it in the last third of a graphics-heavy PDF file) so I’m posting here and letting Google do its thing.

There you have it. Unmute your line on a Blue Jeans video or audio conference call using star-4.

If this helped you, click that heart.
