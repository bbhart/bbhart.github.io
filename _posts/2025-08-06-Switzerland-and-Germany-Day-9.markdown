- **Start of day:** Füssen, Germany
- **End of day:** Garmisch-Partenkirchen, Bavaria, Germany

Another single hotel night, another packing and moving day. Gratefully it's the last quick-move of the trip.[^1] There were a few ways to get from Füssen to Garmisch, including bus 9606 which starts in Füssen and ends in Garmisch and seems good on paper, but I chose a combination bus+train. With the hindsight of having experienced the bus for 25 minutes from Füssen to Pflach, I'm super glad I didn't sign us up for the whole 2h 15m trip on just the bus. The bus driver was taking these windy mountain roads at speed, driving uncomfortably close to the car in front[^2], ripping through towns, etc. He was a minute or two behind schedule and intent on making up the time. 

Instead we took Bus 100 from Füssen to Pflach, Austria. How cute is this train station? The bus dropped off a 3-4 min walk away from the train station. There were two older women on the same bus who were then connecting on the same train, so we walked together and had a little chat. There was a little language barrier with the one woman I was talking to, but we got along OK. She did throw me for a loop, though, on one thing. She compared our crazy bus ride to "That one old Steven Spielberg movie about the car race" and my friends, I had no idea what she was referencing. Once we hit Germany and I had data service, I did some IMDb sleuthing and found [Duel (1971)](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0067023/), which is a wild pull. Full credit to her for knowing her movies!

We waited 15-20 minutes here for the S7 train. It was an hour and 15 minutes to Garmish and honestly one of the most beautiful train rides I've ever had, a list that includes the [Goldenpass Express](https://www.gpx.swiss/en/). 

We had a long-ish but flat walk to the [Hyperion Hotel](https://www.h-hotels.com/en/hyperion/hotels/hyperion-hotel-garmisch-partenkirchen) in Garmisch. We both liked the hotel. There's a great balcony and lots of space in the room, plus it's in a somewhat residential neighborhood but still close to stores and restaurants. For a late lunch we went to nearby [Bungalow 7](https://www.bungalow-7.de/en/) and had the fish & chips. It definitely landed with Rowan, as he wanted to have it again for lunch the next day, but I'm racing ahead of my journal.

[^1]: Not counting the Hilton Munich Airport on the last night of the trip, which was a last minute decision.
[^2]: Yes, the giant bus window is deceptive, but you guys... he was **on their bumper**.
