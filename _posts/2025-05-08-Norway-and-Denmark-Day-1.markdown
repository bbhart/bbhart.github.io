First travel hiccup of the day. First, let me recap how I’m getting to Norway. From Raleigh Durham I fly Southwest  to Baltimore Washington airport. I have a seven hour layover there and then I am on an Icelandair flight to Keflavik, near Reykjavík. After around a four hour layover there, I have an Icelandair flight to Bergen Norway. This was all booked through Icelandair; they’re the ones that booked the first light, the southwest one, for me.

When checking my bag at the southwest counter at the airport, the first luggage tag that was printed out was for KEF. The agent informed me that I would be returning my bag there, passing through customs, and then re-checking my bag for the Norway flight. However, she accidentally printed a second boarding tag, and that boarding tag was for BGO (Bergen). Which one to use? 

She asked her supervisor, who wasn’t sure. The supervisor mentioned that there were some people from Icelandair that happened to be there and so he went to the back and was gone for about five minutes making his inquiries. When he returned, he said to use the Bergen tag. 

From what the ticketing agent said, this partnership with Southwest Airlines is new for Iceland air and so they’re working out the kinks. The agent said that I was literally her first check-in where she had to put this other tag on the bag that indicated that it needed to be transferred from Southwest over to Icelandair in Baltimore. 

Glad I could be the beta tester for all this.
