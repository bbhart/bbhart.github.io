This is day three of me working from home. I’m settling in pretty well, working hard to develop discipline.

*   Shower every morning.
*   Put on clothes (as opposed to working in T-shirt and boxers). Sure, it’s only shorts & a polo, but still no different from acceptable wear in my old office
*   Have a breakfast
*   Be at my desk working at my usual time
*   Not be distracted by other possible activities like watching TV, playing games, etc.
*   Take a real lunch break, try to get out of the house for a bit
*   Try to leave work at the usual time

The nonstop Florida rains this past week have made it difficult to get out at lunchtime. Also, I worked until around 11pm last night, so I’m not necessarily leaving work at the usual time. Still, trying to settle in.

Finally, I’m finding that some simple tasks that I took for granted a few weeks ago have become tougher. I had to create this diagram when trying to get an engineer back in the office to plug my server into the correct port.
