The closing yesterday was smooth. We now own a .3 acre chunk of North Carolina, plus a house sitting on top of it. 
I swear I’m excited, but the stress chemicals have been winning against the happiness chemicals for the past seven days. While I expected this to be challenging physically, I underestimated the mental and emotional toll. We still have the hefty task of unloading the trailer (and yes, I’m hiring a bunch of unloaders this time) weighing on us, and then there are a bunch of other outstanding items to resolve like window treatments so people don’t watch us go potty, ordering something to sleep on that isn’t an air mattress, figuring out our “style” and buying a bunch of furniture, and trying to meet the neighbors in the time of COVID. (Icing on cake: social distancing is mostly lip service here, so we have a decent chance of being the “weird mask people”; OR, when the wave hits, we look prescient and proactively safety-minded. That’s how that works, right?) 

We did manage to check a few items off our list today. There’s a club to apply to in order to get set up with pool passes and such. Pools are open but at 50% capacity, so you have to reserve a 3 hour block at one of the pools. It seems like a reasonable way to handle it, so no big deal. I Supercharged over in Cary (about 12 miles away) since plugging in to 110V at the house is slow and also trips the breaker. 🙁

We also started our furniture shopping. This doesn’t work for our space, but check out this neat table: 
It’s one of several different nifty “leafing” styles. We found a few interesting items at 
this furniture store in Raleigh we just happened to see while leaving another
furniture store. 

Tomorrow’s adventures include welcoming robot vacuum to the family, getting keys to our mailbox, trying to get the new network switch and wireless access points to grab DHCP addresses, maybe more furniture shopping, and whatever else comes up.
