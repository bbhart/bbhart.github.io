Curaçao (or Curacao) is the second of our "ABC" or "Caribbean Netherlands" islands. Like yesterday, and for the same reasons, it was just Siena and I on our scheduled shore excursion. I'd like to say this one was drier than the snorkeling trip yesterday, but it was *very* hot and sticky out today.

We started our day with a hello from Santa:

While on the bus heading to the first stop on our excursion, our tour guide shared some info with us:

* Curacao is moving more toward renewable energy sources, with new windmills being constructed on the north (windiest) side of the island. As of this writing and per [this page](https://www.aspiravi.com/en/markets/curacao-en/#:~:text=Renewable%20energy%20is%20the%20driving,over%20the%20course%20of%202024.), there are 15 wind turbines installed generating 47.3 MW.
* Like Aruba and Bonaire, Curacao is outside the hurricane belt. 
* Papiamentu is the most widely spoken language on the island. It's a Creole language that blends African, Portuguese, Spanish, Dutch, and English influences. School children learn Papiamentu first, then Dutch as a second language. In secondary school English is added. 
* Houses typically have walls surrounding the properties due to wild goats
* Unemployment and crime rates have fluctuated notably. Like many Caribbean islands Curacao is heavily dependent on tourism. The tour guide said there would be more than 300 cruise ship visits this season.

Today's excursion took us to [Hato Caves](https://curacaohatocaves.com/) on the north side of Curacao, adjacent to the international airport, and then a guided walking tour through the downtown.

At the caves:

There were lots of iguanas all around. Our tour guide even told us how [iguanas are on the menu](https://www.uncommoncaribbean.com/guyana/iguana-stew/) for some Curacao residents!

Back in the capital of Willemstad, I enjoyed some of the architecture:

Kraspassi Market is near the downtown and is where vendors from Venezuela (and sometimes other countries) bring their goods to Curacao on boats and sell them along the waterfront near downtown Willemstad. We saw fruits and vegetables, clothing, jewelry, and some other souvenirs. The vendors on these boats live on the boats while they're docked here in Willemstad! I didn't get a great picture, though.

Back on the ship, we enjoyed the twilight hours:
