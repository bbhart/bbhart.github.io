Documenting **August 17, 2024**.

This is day two staying on the south coast of Iceland.

Sherri is pretty sick today, with coughing, sinuses, fevers. She's in bed all day. Despite some of the symptoms being different, it's likely the same crud I had on the ship. There's a high chance it's COVID. 

I went in the morning down to Faxi Bakery a few minutes from the Airbnb and picked up drinks and pastries for folks. The rest of the day was lazy hanging-around.

In the evening Siena and I drove down to see a waterfall.

We were scant on food, meaning I spent 45 minutes cooking bacon so we could have breakfast-dinner.

Tomorrow we check out of this Airbnb and head for Reykjavik.
