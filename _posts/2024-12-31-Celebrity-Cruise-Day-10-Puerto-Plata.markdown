<!-- This is hasty and needs a lot of work --> 

Puerto Plata is a city and major cruise port located on the north side of the Dominican Republic. This was our final stop of the cruise.

Something happened this morning causing data service on all of our phones to be suspended. The tet from AT&T indicated that it would still be suspended when we arrived back in the US, too, so restoring this service became a priority for today. I called the phone number AT&T included in their message and their call center wouldn't open until 10am our time. 

Before the cruise we'd booked a zipline excursion for all four of us. Once son sprained his angle, we took a wait-and-see attitude, since we had lots of time for healing before we made it to this port. Ultimately we canceled him and my wife, and daughter and I still went.

It was a good call. He's able to handle straightaways and stairs now, but getting to some of the ziplines involved some angled stairs, uneven ground, and climbing some tall towers. On the other hand, my wife probably wouldn't have cared for the heights. 

Taino Bay is the secured area between the ships and the city, with shops, restaurants, pools, and lazy river. It's a nice resort-style area but very much at odds with the city just beyond its walls. 

From excursion:
- Tour guide: stay with the group, don't follow anyone else.
- Really talkative guy in front of us (a house painter from Pompano Beach, which he started pronouncing Pom-PAH-no after a drink) and his German wife, odd couple. Friendly, excitable, talks way too much.
- Horse having to collect some of the lighter zipliners... zipline 6, maybe?
- EXIF shows zipline was in San Felipe De Puerto Plata
- DR was the pushiest port wrt forced reviews and tips. 
- Multiple places hadn't heard of Diet Coke, only Coke and Coke Zero.
- Staff at zipline were friendly but very limited English.
- It looked like the same facility also offered ATV and horseback trips. They may have even offered lodging, not sure.

Security coming back from the shore excursion, a security person came into the bus and had everyone show their ship cards.

Siena and I stopped for coffee so I could use the wifi and try to fix our broken data service. Unsurprisingly, the mall's wifi was pretty bad. But the coffee was great! We took the tuk tuk service back.

Back on the ship I made a call to AT&T and had things sorted after about 20 minutes. Truly I have no idea what our cell bill will look like, and may have to make more calls to AT&T in a month to sort it all out.

Son and wife left the ship while we were on our excursion and walked around for awhile. 

Later in the afternoon wife and daughter went to to Taino Bay to enjoy the lazy river and resort area. I caught up with them a bit later and then we all walked back about half an hour before gangway up. Daughter tried 'splash surfing' attraction, also. The pool, river, and splash surfing were all free for cruise passengers.
