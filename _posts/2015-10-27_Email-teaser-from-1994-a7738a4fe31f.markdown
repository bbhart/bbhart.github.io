The email below is from 1994, and is regarding the UCF InPrint newspaper, a publication I co-founded to cover topics of interest to the University of Central Florida community.

In addition to 9,000 “dead tree” copies of the newspaper, we provided a WWW version of parts of the paper, as well as highlights in an email teaser. I’m still proud of our decision to steadfastly create online editions of our publication, despite the extra work and low readership each week.
