Thanksgiving 2010 was chock full of activity for the Celebration Harts this year. Rowan’s nap schedule kept us in the Orlando area this year, despite a generous offer to rejoin the Ormond Beach Harts. In the morning we went to [Disney’s Animal Kingdom](http://disneyworld.disney.go.com/parks/animal-kingdom/). We purchased our Florida resident annual passes while there, after waiting in a baffling ticket line. The line wasn’t long, but the wait was. Apparently some people there were either attempting a corporate takeover at the ticket wicket or else they were trying to haggle the agents down or something.

Anyway, we passed a fine morning here, and even though I had a [disappointing hot dog](http://www.flickr.com/photos/brianhart/5207930917/), I think the boy enjoyed himself. We got to see birds and ducks and tigers and bats and an alligator that may or may not have been real depending on whether you ask Rowan’s mother or father.

We left to go home around lunchtime so Rowan could have his nap. The benefits of living adjacent to the parks, eh?

After Rowan was up and fed, we headed out to Magic Kingdom. Now, as far as I recall, I hadn’t been to Magic Kingdom since I worked there in Cash Control in the summer of 1996, and the Mrs. hadn’t been there since 1989. Plus, I don’t think I’ve been the MK _at night_… ever? That can’t be true, but I honestly can’t remember a time being there at night. Anyway, we took the ferry over, which is a nice ride. It was basically dark by the time we got to the main gates (5:30 or so) which made picture-taking difficult but we managed to squeeze out a few. First stop was on the WEDway People Mover — which it’s not called anymore, but it will always be WEDway to me. We did a lot of walking through the night, but eventually made it around to see the whole park, and while the only “attractions” we went on were the WEDway, Treehouse, and Riverboat, we still had a great time.

Two parks in one day is a lot of work for sure. There’s a lot of overhead involved in going to a park, and that’s coming from people that live 5 miles away. Dressing Rowan, packing a cooler for him, driving to the park, getting parked, packing the stroller, walking to the entrance, having bags searched, going through turnstiles… you’re exhausted by the time you even walk in. Then double it — that’s what we did today. And for some reason I’m still up talking about it, so that’s my cue to wrap up.

Some random observations before I leave you:

*   I never realized they got rid of the ride on top of where you board the WEDway. What was that ride called? It was cool because it was rocket ships instead of Dumbos and it was so high up.
*   I’m wondering if Transportation is cost-neutral. Does the price of parking ($14 for cars) cover the cost of running the monorails, ferries, parking attendants, trams and tram drivers, and so on?
*   I was really impressed that the Liberty Square Riverboat is an actual paddlewheel steamship. Steam. That means boilers and pistons and heat and a lot of maintenance. It’s very cool to me that Disney hasn’t mucked with these. I appreciated feeling the heat coming from the boiler and seeing the pistons turn the wheel. It’s a nice touch in a place where you question the authenticity of _everything_.
*   Along the same lines, I’m glad the ferry is there from TTC to MK. It’s another case where the numbers might be better business to add a monorail or two instead, but taking that boat across the lake is part of the experience.
*   For some reason I was under the strong impression that Tom Sawyer Island was closed for good ala 20,000 Leagues, but this isn’t the case. Unless my parents took me when I was really little, I’ve never set foot on it. I’m adding it to the list for next time.
*   [20,000 Leagues Under the Sea](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/20,000_Leagues_Under_the_Sea:_Submarine_Voyage) is probably the kind of thing my son would’ve enjoyed. It’s sad that I can’t share this experience from my childhood with him. :(
*   Turkey Legs were calling out to me. They’re low in carbs _and_ it was Thanksgiving. Still, they did not woo me this time.
*   There are no less than 280 carts you can buy popcorn from at Magic Kingdom.
*   Parades are **Serious Business**.

Overall we had a great time at both parks, which is fortunate because we gave $DIS about $800 today for an annual pass for a year.
