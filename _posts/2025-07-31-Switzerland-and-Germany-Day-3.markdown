Today we met up early to ride up [the gondola](https://www.maennlichen.ch/en/summer/information/fare-prices-from-wengen.html) to Männlichen to do the Männlichen to Kleine Scheidegg walk. It's the third time I've done this walk but the first time I've turned left at the top of the lift and hiked up to the "[crown](https://www.maennlichen.ch/en/summer/experiences/royal-walk.html)" at the very top. It's not a bad uphill but enough to get the heart rate up. The weather wasn't as cooperative as in previous visits, gray and damp this time.

At Kleine Scheidegg we took some time to have a snack -- chicken or sausage roll thing for Rowan, hot coffee for me -- then made our way back to Wengen.

Later in the afternoon we met back up again with Joshua and Max to descend down to Lauterbrunnen. We hiked up and behind [Staubbach Falls](https://lauterbrunnen.swiss/en/map/detail/staubbachfall-waterfall-72e97e9f-26fb-4ec2-ba72-c035d9d03e75.html) and then along the valley a little bit further before heading back to the train.

I regret not going up to Mürren and doing the walk back to Grütschalp station. I quite enjoyed that last time. 

For dinner we went to The Deck, which was at the turn toward the Alpenrühe I stayed at last year and had had my eyes on previously. I wish I had gone earlier! As one might gather from the name, the deck at [The Deck](https://jungfraublick.com/restaurant/?lang=en) has a fantastic view. The people occupying our reserved table were running behind, so we had extra time to enjoy the outside. Once at dinner, Max ordered the fondue and Rowan decided to give it a go. He was a good sport about it but it wasn't his favorite. Josh and I both ordered the Entrecôte and it was not good. Not medium rare, not flavorful at all… oh well. At least the weather had cleared and we had a nice after dinner walk and talk around the village.

Sadly we leave Wengen tomorrow. I never seem to have enough time here.
