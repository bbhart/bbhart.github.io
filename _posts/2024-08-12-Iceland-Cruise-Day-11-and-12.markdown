I'm lazy and combining August 12 and 13 (cruise days 11 and 12).

We did encounter the forecast rough seas after midnight after leaving Qaqortoq. The captain said later there were 60mph winds and 5 meter seas. The rocking was rough but not overly so.

The seas continued to make their presence known the next two days. 

I wonder what the black squares are over Greenland:

I was making my way through a cold these days, so much of the time I was hermited in the room. On the second day I broke down and bought some pricy Nyquil from the onboard store and started dosing that. I still slept like absolute garbage for a few nights.

Rowan and Siena have spent most of their waking hours with their ship friends. I know they're both dreading the last night of the cruise.

Our sunset for August 12:

Siena's phone got itself into a state and we had to wait for the battery to die to fix it. It wouldn't even respond to attempts to hard power cycle.

As the parent of a teenage girl, I'm very glad that the hard reboot fixed it.
