We arrived at 8am to chilly temperatures and pouring rain. The town itself doesn't offer much unless you're embarking from here on a tour. It has a similar working town vibe to Qaqortoq.

The rain (mostly) stopped by midmorning, so Sher and I left the kids onboard to walk through the town and back, stopping at the tourist information booth on the pier to leech their wifi. We even spotted a Cybertruck:

I'm at the tail end of being sick and starting to get my bounce back, just in time to end the cruise. Unfortunately, Sherri feels like she's starting to come down with it. We still have 5 more days before our long flight, so I'm very much hoping everyone is in decent shape by then. 

Islafjordur reminds me of photos I've seen of the Scottish Highlights.
