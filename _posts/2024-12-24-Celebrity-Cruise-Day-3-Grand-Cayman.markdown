Not a lot to share today. The ship was tendered outside George Town, Grand Cayman. The weather was gray most of the day, with temperatures in the high 70's and humid. 

Two other ships were tendered near us, one NCL I forget the name of, and the RCCL Brilliance of the Seas, which from far away first looked like Reliance on the Seas to me... technically true.

Son spent most of the day in the stateroom today. Despite several attempts to have him download shows and movies to his iPad before leaving home, he did not. He's lucky, then, that his father managed to cache some things.

Daughter and I wandered the ship some, listening to music and admiring the holiday decorations.

In the evening the main dining room featured a special menu. We suspected there would be something special, one because it's Christmas Eve, and two because all the Celebrity app showed for dinner was wine.[^1]

After dinner me and the kids went up to the top deck lawn and took in what felt like ~40 knot winds.

We did not end up going to "Christmas Eve Party With Party Band Next Stage". Instead we all called it an early night.
