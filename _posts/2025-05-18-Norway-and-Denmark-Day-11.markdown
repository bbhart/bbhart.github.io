I hit the travel wall today. 

I didn't sleep well. It was rainy and gray out. I was tired, tired of being a solo traveler, tired of sleeping in strange beds. I was ready to be home. 

<img src="/assets/20250518-copenhagen1.jpg" alt="The image shows a street scene in Copenhagen on a cloudy day. On the left, a narrow sidewalk runs alongside tall, traditional European-style buildings with beige and red brick facades and arched windows. Parked vehicles line the cobblestone-edged street, including a white van labeled 'Øland's Kloakmester,' which advertises plumbing and sewage services. Red and white traffic posts are positioned near the curb, possibly for temporary construction or parking restrictions. On the right, more classic Copenhagen apartment buildings with white-framed windows and red or grey brickwork are visible. Trees are spaced along the street, and the wet pavement suggests recent rain." />

On the left side, there is a long, green building with evenly spaced windows and a covered overhang with round lights. A few pedestrians are walking along the wide, clean sidewalk. On the right, cars are parked along the curb in front of elegant, historic apartment buildings with ornate white façades, decorative molding, and small balconies. The street is lined with modern, minimalistic lampposts, and a no-parking sign is visible in the center. The damp pavement and overcast sky suggest it recently rained." />

A giant Pad Thai and pseudo-Diet Coke helped a little.

The dish consists of stir-fried rice noodles with beef, scrambled egg, bean sprouts, green onions, and a savory, slightly reddish sauce. On the side, there is a wedge of lime, a small salad with shredded cabbage, carrots, and sliced red onion, and two small glass bowls containing crushed peanuts and dried chili flakes. A glass bottle of Coca-Cola Zero Sugar and an empty water glass are also on the table. A lit tealight candle adds a warm, inviting touch to the dining setting." />

That's it for today. Tomorrow: the journey home.
