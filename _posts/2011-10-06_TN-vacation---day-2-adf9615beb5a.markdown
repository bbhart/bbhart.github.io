We woke up in Clinton, SC, this morning and arrived in Johnson City, TN, around 11:30. It rained most of the way up, and then continued to rain most of the rest of the day. Going up and down the hills is not making my head pressure problem any better; in fact, it’s much worse.

My brother and his family came by for dinner, which included teriyaki flank steak and 1905 Salad, so it was all good.

As expected, the Boy was a little standoffish around all the new people, but got into it towards the end and was running around and carrying on with the rest. The baby did what babies do.
