- **Start of day:** Garmisch-Partenkirchen, Germany
- **End of day:** Garmisch-Partenkirchen, Germany

Another beautiful weather day here in southern Germany! I was able to sit comfortably on the patio in shorts at 8:30am. I woke Rowan around 10:00am. He's not a big hiker, so I set out to find a nearby, low effort walk for us. (It's that path leading from the south tip of town south toward the tree line.)

Once you cross the train tracks at the tree line, it's around 270 feet of vertical ascent to reach [Riessersee Hotel](https://www.riessersee-hotel.de/startseite) and Riessersee Lake. The hotel there looks pretty nice, with the disadvantage of not being right in town. We took the [short 1.2km trail](https://www.outdooractive.com/en/route/hiking-trail/garmisch-partenkirchen/riessersee-circular-trail/42432379/) around the lake, then walked back down the hill to our hotel. It was beautiful!

On the walk back to the hotel I came across this nice resting spot:

Rowan wasn't hungry at lunchtime so I got [takeout Pad Thai from a place up the street](https://thaistreetfood-garmisch.de/speisekarte). This is another place I'd definitely return to as the food was good and the service friendly.

Being honest, the afternoon was pretty boring. We should've visited [Eibsee](https://www.gapa-tourismus.de/en/Summer/Trips/Attractions/Lake%20Eibsee) but I think we both still had some bus + train burnout after the long days getting here. We considered [Zugspitze](https://zugspitze.de/en), also, but we'd already done [Gornergrat](https://www.gornergrat.ch/en/) in Switzerland, which feels similar. Further, for Gornergrat we had a Swiss half fare card and Rowan rode for free. We had none of that here in Germany, which would've put the roundtrip price at more than $100.

Toward the evening we had an outdoor dinner at [Restaurant Zum Lamm](https://maps.app.goo.gl/uSoT2BBjetbBNvgi9), where Rowan ordered something called the Treasure Chest which was like a bunch of appetizers served together (he really liked it, especially the onion rings (!?)) and I satisfied myself with a salad. OH! And they had our old flatware.

Afterwards we walked around town so I could get some photos.
