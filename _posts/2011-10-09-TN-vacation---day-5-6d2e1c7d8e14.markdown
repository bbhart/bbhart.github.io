**September 8, 2011**

Another delightfully lazy day in the Tri-Cities area of eastern Tennessee. The two year old has been pushing limits, as usual, and the girl has slept a lot of the day away… and when she’s been awake, she’s been doing cute baby stuff like smiling and cooing.

I don’t believe it will get any warmer than 70 today. Nice. A much needed reprieve from our looooong Florida summer.

My condition feels even better today. Still very much there, mind you, but starting to approach something I’d consider livable. Perhaps this is the start of something wonderful.

Some of the day was spent rifling through some of the boxes in storage, where I came across our old Legos:

And a Marklin train starter set:

We packed the car aggressively this trip, but there still isn’t any spare room, so these won’t make it down to Florida until a future trip. Probably for the best, anyway, as the kids aren’t old enough. Tomorrow we’re planning to get out and about, either playing at my brother’s family’s house or going to one of those places where they have a bunch of inflatable bouncy houses set up in warehouse.
