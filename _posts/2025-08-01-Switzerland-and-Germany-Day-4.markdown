Moving day again! Who's excited for 4 hours of trains and transfers!?

We all met at the Wengen train station around 8:50 to start to make our way to Zermatt. Today's route was Wengen to Lauterbrunnen to Interlaken Ost to Visp to Zermatt. It was the busiest train travel I've encountered in Switzerland so far. For one segment, I can't remember which (or I've blocked it out), we were all crammed with our luggage into the boarding area of the train for about 25 minutes. All told I think the trains totaled 4 hours or so. With crowded trains, very little time to transfer between them, and suitcases to find space for, it was a moderately stressful day. 

**And then we were in Zermatt!** Which tends to make the stress go away. We had a healthy walk from the train station to Hotel Albatros, at least 15 minutes, possibly 20. Clear across town. Josh and Max were staying at a different hotel but in the same general area.

We arrived around 1:15 and our room wouldn't be ready 'til two. Exhausted, we were content to lounge in the hotel lobby with a ham sandwich we'd bought at the bakery down the street. Once we got up to the room, we relaxed on our balcony and enjoyed the cool-but-not-cold fresh air.

Later that afternoon, we did our own exploring until early evening when we met up with Joshua and Max for dinner at [Restaurant Pinte](https://www.hotelpollux.ch/en/gastronomy/pinte). Pinte did not have amazing signage but DID have good weinerschnitzel. We sat outside next to the menu board, which is always weird as people come and stand two feet next to you.

It was Swiss National Day, which meant live music and other activities around town. Joshua and I caught the beginning of one act, who were GREAT!, but I was concerned about aggravating my tinnitus so I went on a photo walk instead.

Oh, this was the first of several place where I'd procure distilled water for my CPAP from the pharmacy.

Tomorrow: hike, cart, and bike.
