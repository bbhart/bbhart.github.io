I couldn’t 100% tell which of the 20 devices on my home network was my Tesla Model 3.

I moved it to the Guest network, which was much less cluttered, and found it immediately. Before you go through that trouble, you might look for devices with MAC addresses beginning with 7C:1C:4E ([https://aruljohn.com/mac/7C1C4E](https://aruljohn.com/mac/7C1C4E)).

Your mileage may vary, and it’s very possibly different for Tesla Model S and X, but that was for my Model 3. Hope this helps.
