Our 12 night cruise from Bayonne, NJ, to Reykjavik, Iceland, comes to an end.

With the kids now 15 and 13, we opted _not_ to put our luggage out the night before, figuring we could all walk off the next morning without issue. That worked well, and I expect that will be our norm going forward. For the unitiated, cruises like you to put your big suitcase(s) out the night before, and then pick it up on the pier the next morning so that disembarkation isn't a total nightmare.

I'll cover our ground transportation in the next blog post, where I'll start a new series that covers the non-cruise part of our Iceland trip. We reported to our bus meeting spot in the theater at the appointed time but there was no signage or direction by crew members there, so we decided to make our way off the ship and find our bus. This ended up being the right call.

It's a crisp, cloudless day, with temps in the low 50's. Time to hit the road.
