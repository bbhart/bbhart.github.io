Documenting **August 19, 2024**.

Today we say goodbye to our apartment and Iceland.

As mentioned a few days ago, Iceland is lovely but we're ready to be home. There's a logic to wanting to stay in Iceland a few more days after getting off a ship here: we're _already here_, it'd be a shame to squander the opportunity. But we're all tired and still a little sick and homesick and kind of cold and it doesn't help that the weather in Holly Springs is warm and sunny. 

Checkout is 11am and our car to the airport will pick us up at that time. Our flight isn't until 4:45p. I'm not excited about finding ways to kill 4 hours at the airport, but I'm even *less* excited about the logistics of trying to find some other way to occupy that time... with luggage in tow. So: we wait.

Back in RDU, Global Entry was a breeze. We had a not-great Uber experience but I won't bore you with that. The house was in great shape when we arrived, and you'd hardly know we were gone.
