Last day in India. Low-grade sickness has kicked my ass the past few days. It’s something I picked up somewhere on the way to India, and then I haven’t been able to overcome it. The constant sore throat and sinus drip made it tough to sleep; my average has been 4 1/2–5 hours a night. Friday I surrendered to the cold and lack of sleep and didn’t leave the hotel room all day. Today (Saturday) I feel a little bit better. Today is also the day I start the long journey back to the States. I accomplished what I needed to here in Bangalore, I only wish I had felt better in the process.

My brother is trying to build [his YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC16vOHhujPHHUJQWSIWkvmw), with an initial goal of 100 subscribers so he can customize the URL. If you’re able to subscribe, it would be appreciated. He posts high quality content that can help you understand personal finance.

Woman a few chairs down from me is on the phone, giving some very candid feedback. “You interrupt a lot. You’re interrupting me again. When you have a conversation, you’re entirely focused on what you want to get out of the conversation. You need to be self-aware.” And so on. Not yelling, very matter-of-fact. The British accent takes out some of the sting but it’s still 🔥.
