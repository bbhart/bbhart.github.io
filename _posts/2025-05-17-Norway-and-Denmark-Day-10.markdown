- **Start of day:** _Nordic Crown_ ferry, somewhere between Oslo and Copenhagen
- **End of day:** [Copenhagen Strand](https://www.copenhagenstrand.com/) hotel, Copenhagen Denmark

One of the first things I learned this morning is there are two "subway" systems in Copenhagen: the Metro and the S-train. Further complicating matters, near the DFDS ferry terminal I arrived in, Google Maps seems to think these stations are in the same place. They are not.

<img src="/assets/20250517-copenhagen1.jpg" alt="The image shows a modern train station platform on a sunny day. In the foreground, a dark navy blue hard-shell suitcase with an extended handle stands on the paved platform. A white bicycle symbol is painted on the ground, indicating a designated bike area. Across the train tracks, there are several modern office buildings with large glass windows and red-brick sections. One of the buildings has 'IDS' signage. A person is standing further down the platform, and overhead, there are electronic signs and lights attached to the canopy. The sky is bright blue with a few scattered clouds." />

The train I was looking for was supposed to pass every few minutes, but after around 15 minutes of trains stopping that _weren't_ mine, I hopped on one heading in the general direction I needed to go. Not always the best idea, but it was mid-morning and my suitcase was the rolling kind, so I had bandwidth for an adventure. I hopped off in a few stops once Google Maps showed I was starting to veer away from the hotel. That's when I made my Metro discovery and was able to take that to a few blocks from the Copenhagen Strand, my hotel for the next two nights.

I wasn't able to early check-in here so I dropped my bag and set off to explore. Actually, first I had a side quest: to replace my lost Kindle before my long flights home. [Elgiganten](https://www.elgiganten.se/) seems to be their Best Buy equivalent. Alas, they had no Kindles of any kind. And their inventory system showed none in stock in any of their other nearby stores. Either Copenhageners are voracious buyers of Kindles, or there's an opportunity here for Amazon. 

Having failed/abandoned that quest, I went to find some lunch instead. I showed up right at open for a Thai place and was the only patron while I was there. Upon checkout, two things happened in quick succession that I haven't encountered anywhere else in my travels: 1) they charged me more than $4.00 USD for tap water (the check literally said _Tap Water_), and as I was paying with my credit card the server reached over and chose US Dollars on the point-of-sale for me instead of the local currency[^1], which is incredibly presumptuous (and wrong). I'm not naming the place but it was my first off-putting restaurant experience in recent memory. 

The Pad Thai was good at least:

The dish includes stir-fried rice noodles with beef, bean sprouts, green onions, crushed peanuts, and scrambled egg, garnished with a lime wedge and fresh chives. To the side, there's a glass pitcher of water with lemon slices, an empty glass, a lit tealight candle, and a small vase with pink and white flowers. A condiment caddy with jars of chili flakes, vinegar, and sliced red chilies in oil sits on the table. The background reveals a cozy restaurant interior with green walls, wooden furnishings, and warm hanging lights." />

I spent most of the afternoon either walking or sitting + people watching. Copenhagen seems fantastic for this. The weather was great, tour groups were out in force (always fun to watch), and I enjoyed seeing Copenhagers go about their Saturday activities. 

Later in the afternoon I checked into my hotel and relaxed for a bit. 

<img src="/assets/20250517-strand1.jpg" alt="The image shows a neatly arranged, modern hotel room at the Copenhagen Strand hotel. The room features light wooden flooring, a large window letting in natural light, and minimalist Scandinavian-style furnishings. A single bed is placed against the right wall with a dark blue rug beneath it, along with a light gray blanket and a gray pillow. A small round side table stands next to the bed. On the left side, there's a wooden desk with two matching chairs, equipped with a modern desk lamp, a phone, and a TV remote. A large mirror is mounted on the wall next to the bed, reflecting parts of the room. A few snacks and a bottle of sparkling water or wine are visible in the foreground on a side table. The view through the window shows rooftops and light-colored buildings, consistent with Copenhagen's architecture." />

A double bed with white linens, gray throw pillows, and a checkered blanket is positioned on the left, backed by a light blue accent wall and a padded headboard. A small round wooden side table and a wall-mounted reading lamp are beside the bed. On the right side, there's a wooden desk with a modern lamp and a wooden chair, set below a wall-mounted flat-screen TV. A mini-bar and storage shelf are located near the door. The room also includes a tall white fan and a tan leather chair in the corner. The decor is minimalist and Scandinavian in style, with clean lines, light wood floors, and soft natural lighting." />


I went for a long walk-around to find an interesting dinner place before ending up at an excellent Pakistani restaurant 70 meters from my hotel. 

I saved the main attraction for the evening: Tivoli Gardens! Getting there was easy. After my earlier subway experiences, I felt like a pro navigating the Metro. They're clean, convenient, and automated!

<img src="/assets/20250517-metrostation.jpg" alt="The image shows a modern Copenhagen Metro station, viewed from the top of an escalator. The station features clean, minimalist design with smooth gray stone walls, a geometric ceiling, and bright lighting. Multiple passengers are waiting on the platform, some standing near the glass safety barriers that separate the platform from the train tracks. Digital signs display upcoming train arrivals with destinations such as Ørestad, Østerport, and København H. A large round clock is visible above the escalators, and signage on the walls and platforms is clear and easy to read, consistent with Copenhagen’s well-organized public transport system." />

I could've gotten there on bike, too. Copenhagen is VERY well set up for bike travel, and the Danes **love** their bikes. I can't blame them! 

<img src="/assets/20250517-copenhagen-bikes.jpg" alt="The image shows a large number of bicycles parked in neat rows along a cobblestone path beside a historic red brick building in Copenhagen, likely near Tivoli Gardens. The building has pointed towers, arched windows, and decorative stonework, suggesting it may be a former industrial or institutional structure now repurposed. Bicycles of various styles and colors fill the racks and are also locked along the fence and walls, reflecting Copenhagen’s strong cycling culture. The scene is captured in the soft light of early evening with a clear blue sky above. A few pedestrians can be seen in the background along the wide sidewalk." />

But anyway, on to Tivoli! Let me digress for a minute. If you don't know, Tivoli Gardens (or "Tivoli") is an amusement park that opened in August of 1843. That's a long time ago. As someone who worked at the Magic Kingdom and EPCOT in Orlando, I'm always interested in seeing how other theme parks are set up, and Tivoli was at the tip-top of my list of places to visit for this. 

I had a chance to visit in 2000 when I visited Copenhagen for an evening when I worked for Celebrity Cruises, but the people I was with weren't interested. They were South Americans who were drawn like moths to flame to the Hard Rock Cafe instead, so that's what we did. It was _okay_. I overpaid for the iconic Hard Rock Cafe Copenhagen shirt and then managed to lose it within the year. Aaaaanyway...

Tivoi was incredible. I'm so glad I went at night. Amusement parks are just better at night. I have yet to be convinced otherwise. I paid my admission and spent the next few hours walking around, snacking, and people-watching. It's so great! It's the perfect size. It's an oasis in the city. It's still very much part of the city -- you can see the nearby office buildings and sometimes spot traffic beyond the fences -- but exists as its own thing, too. It's such an odyssey getting to any of the Disney parks in Orlando that the idea of hopping off a subway and within a few minutes you're through the gates of an amusement park... I just love it. 

I'll share some photos here but really it needs to be visited.

At the center is the iconic open-air Peacock Theatre, with its elaborate Oriental-style architecture featuring gold roofs, intricate red and black patterns, and a large, colorful peacock design on the stage backdrop. Traditional lantern-style street lamps with warm glowing lights line the grassy area in front. A few visitors walk or sit on benches, enjoying the serene atmosphere. On the right, flowerbeds and a lit-up restaurant sign add to the lively yet peaceful charm of the scene. Trees and decorative greenery frame the area, while the modern, angular facade of the Tivoli Concert Hall is visible in the background." />

On the left, there's a traditional stone lantern standing on a bed of white gravel surrounded by rocks and lush greenery. To the right, a red wooden bridge decorated with string lights and golden accents extends over the water, with several visitors enjoying the view. The lake reflects the soft lighting and surrounding trees, creating a peaceful, atmospheric scene. In the background, weeping willows and historic buildings add to the charm, blending natural beauty with Tivoli’s decorative and cultural elements." />

In the foreground, a large decorative fountain with white flower-shaped structures is lit up with soft lighting, and streams of water arc from the edges. Beyond the fountain, a brightly lit vintage carousel glows with golden lights, forming the centerpiece of the scene. Behind it stands the distinctive facade of the Tivoli Concert Hall, adorned with a row of flagpoles displaying red-and-white Danish flags. To the right, the green-lit tower of one of Tivoli's thrill rides is visible above the trees, while clusters of visitors stroll through the park’s warmly lit paths. The overall atmosphere is festive and enchanting." />

After a few hours of Tivoli, I decided to take in the city by doing the 2 km walk back to my hotel instead of Metro-ing. Overall a very memorable day in the capital of Denmark.

Once you tap/swipe your card, a screen pops up asking whether you want to pay in 1) the local currency, or 2) US dollars. You should always choose the local currency, as your credit card company will almost certainly give you a better exchange rate than the point-of-sale provider is offering.
