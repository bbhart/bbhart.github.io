Today we are in Aruba. This is the first of our "ABC Islands": Aruba, Bonaire, and Cura√ßao. All three islands are constituent countries within the Kingdom of the Netherlands. It has its own government, led by a Prime Minister, but the King of the Netherlands serves as its head of state.

Siena and I had the first of our scheduled shore excursions today, a sailing and snorkeling trip lasting around 3 hours. We had originally planned this for all four of us, then canceled when Rowan twisted his ankle. In hindsight he likely could have come and just not snorkeled. Live and learn.

All was not lost as Rowan was able to make a new friend, Christopher, through their shared interest in Brawl Stars.
