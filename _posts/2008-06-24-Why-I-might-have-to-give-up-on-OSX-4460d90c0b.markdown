As you may recall reading, I bought myself an iMac awhile ago. My intention was to use it as my full-time work PC, no matter how painful it would be initially, so that I could learn the ins and outs of OSX.

It’s been death by a thousand cuts.

\* Mouse acceleration. It’s just f’d. Mouse feel sluggish or sticky. It takes more effort and concentration to position the pointer than I’d like. Google ‘osx mouse’ to see what I mean. **This is the dealbreaker for me at this point.** Argh.  
\* Home/End keys. They don’t go to the beginning or end of a line.  
\* No decent Exchange client. Thus, I need to run Outlook 2007 in a VM instead. Works _pretty well_, until I need to deal with attachments. Then it sucks.  
\* Switching between applications. Switching between windows in the same application. Between Ctrl/Tab, Option/Tab, and Command/Tab, I can’t keep them straight. I’d swear there aren’t any standards between applications.  
\* Showing the Applications folder is sloooow.   
\* Many other things.

I had such high hopes for OSX, but at this point it’s impacting my work, so if you need me, I’ll be booted into Windows.
