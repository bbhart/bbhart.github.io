At the bottom of the hill, near the [Sun Voyager](https://guidetoiceland.is/travel-iceland/drive/sun-voyager) sculpture, is a little bakery. I found a spot in the corner, had a coffee and croissant, and caught up on some news.

Today was a wet, chilly day, with mostly light rain with some heavier at times. Not the best day to be taking in the sites. I was thankful for my Columbia rain jacket.

There's a punk museum over by the Prime Minister's house:

Reykjavik's iconic rainbow road:

Another iconic venue is [Hús máls og menningar](https://husmalsogmenningar.is/), a bookstore with a bar and live music.

Daughter and I did some souvenir shopping (pot holder and coaster) and walked around a bit. Otherwise we were mostly indoors today, with the exception of wife and son popping out for Oreo ice cream.

## Last dinner in Iceland

In the evening three of us set out to Subway (eat fresh!). Wife and daughter wanted something quick and predictable for dinner.

I was set on trying to find a restaurant for myself for my last dinner in Iceland, but I couldn't get past my introversion enough to sit in a busy restaurant by myself, though I did end up walking about 2.5 miles, which was good exercise. 

Tomorrow we need to be out by 11am, so I have a car arranged and I really hope they show up on time, as more rain is predicted. This gets us to the airport around 11:45am for a 4:45pm flight, but I don't see a way around it. Better early than late and all that, right? It will be a long day. The flight itself is 6.5 hours, and with the time difference we land around 7:30pm EDT. I've booked for us to do our Global Entry interviews on arrival.  Plus get our bags, schlep to the economy lot, drive home... and then I repack for a trip to NYC the next day. Whew. I'll be a happy camper come June 24.
