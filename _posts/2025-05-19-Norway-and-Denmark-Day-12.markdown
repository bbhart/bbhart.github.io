- **Start of day:** [Copenhagen Strand](https://www.copenhagenstrand.com/) hotel, Copenhagen Denmark
- **End of day:** Holly Springs, North Carolina, USA

Heaven is a flight that doesn't leave at 6am. Today's is 2pm. Ample time to be lazy at the hotel, check out at the last minute, catch the train to the airport, have a bite of lunch, and hop onto an airplane. 

Making my way to the Metro station.

Behind him is a historic European cityscape featuring a large bronze statue of a man in historical attire pointing forward, mounted on a stone pedestal with smaller figures at its base. The background includes ornate brick buildings with white-framed windows and a dark-tiled roof, and a tall tower visible in the distance. The sky is clear and blue, and the area appears to be in a central part of a European city, possibly Copenhagen based on the architectural style." />

<img src="/assets/20250519-copenhagen2.jpg" alt="The image shows the entrance to the Kongens Nytorv metro station in Copenhagen, Denmark. The entrance is a modern glass structure with a red 'M' metro logo on top and the station name displayed beneath it. It's located in a busy urban square in front of the historic Magasin du Nord department store, a large beige building with arched windows and ornate architectural details. The area in front of the station is filled with parked bicycles, and a few people can be seen walking nearby. The sky is clear with a few wispy clouds, indicating a sunny day." />

I thought the subway system map looked cool, like a clue in a video game or something:
<img src="/assets/20250519-copenhagen3.jpg" alt="The image shows a simplified Copenhagen Metro map displayed on a board at a station platform. The map features colored lines representing different metro routes: green (M1), yellow (M2), red (M3), and blue (M4). The red line forms a circular route (Cityringen), while the others branch off in different directions. Key transfer stations and zones are marked along the lines. The surrounding frame is made of glass and metal, and part of a metro train is visible in the background on the left side. The sky is partly cloudy with sunlight casting shadows on the pavement." />

The Copenhagen airport was clean and nice and a little confusing in the check-in area, making it pretty standard for the region:
<img src="/assets/20250519-copenhagen-airport1.jpg" alt="The image shows an entrance corridor at Copenhagen Airport with a sign overhead that reads 'Welcome to Copenhagen Airport' in English. The area is bright with natural light streaming through large glass walls. Travelers are seen walking or pulling luggage toward various exits and escalators. Overhead directional signs in yellow on dark blue point to locations such as Clarion & Comfort Hotel, car rental center, parking areas, public transport, and Terminals 2 and 3. The floor is made of light gray tiles, and there are escalators leading to a lower level in the center of the walkway." />

<img src="/assets/20250519-copenhagen-airport2.jpg" alt="The image shows an interior corridor at Copenhagen Airport featuring a high ceiling with skylights, polished wood flooring, and a large central clock hanging at the far end. Travelers are walking along the elevated walkway, some pulling luggage. On both sides of the corridor are glass railings overlooking lower levels. Large vertical banners with the SAS airline logo and the slogan 'We are Scandinavia' are displayed prominently on the walls. The modern architecture and spacious design give the area a bright and airy atmosphere." />

My chariot:

The aircraft has a sleek white body with bold blue 'ICELANDAIR' lettering along the fuselage and a blue and green tail fin. Ground crew and various service vehicles are positioned around the plane, attending to tasks such as baggage handling and refueling. The scene is viewed from inside the terminal through large glass windows, with a few people standing near the viewing area on the right. The weather outside is clear and sunny, and the airport tarmac stretches into the distance under a bright blue sky." />

Iceland's Kevlavik airport, the international airport for this part of Iceland and a major gateway between the US and Europe. We're _very_ familiar with this airport at this point.
<img src="/assets/20250519-keflavik.jpg" alt="The image shows a corridor inside Keflavík International Airport (KEF) in Iceland. The ceiling is covered with red square panels, and the floor is made of light gray tiles. The passageway is well-lit, with travelers walking in both directions. Overhead signs indicate gate numbers and directions, including one with ‘KEF’ and gate A11 clearly marked. Along the right side, there's a light blue advertisement and a few wheelchairs positioned by the wall. To the left, trash and recycling bins are placed beneath a long digital display showing scenic Icelandic landscapes. The area has a clean, modern, and organized appearance." />

The (in)famous [Blue Lagoon](https://www.bluelagoon.com/) near Keflavik airport:
<img src="/assets/20250519-bluelagoon.jpg" alt="The image shows an aerial view of Iceland’s Blue Lagoon, a popular geothermal spa located in a rugged volcanic landscape near the southwestern coast. The lagoon appears as a bright, milky-blue body of water surrounded by dark, rocky terrain. Steam can be seen rising from the nearby geothermal power facilities, and winding roads lead to and from the complex. The shoreline and the shimmering North Atlantic Ocean are visible in the background, with waves gently meeting the coast. The contrast between the blue lagoon, reddish earth, and black lava fields creates a striking natural scene." />

It was a nice clear-ish day, so I was able to get some shots of Greenland:
<img src="/assets/20250519-greenland1.jpg" alt="The image shows an aerial view of Greenland taken from high altitude on a clear day. Large expanses of snow-covered mountains and rugged terrain are visible below, with patches of exposed dark rock and deep blue water bodies in between. In the lower part of the image, the coastline is sharply defined, with icy formations and scattered icebergs extending into the sea. The upper portion of the image shows a layer of soft, streaked clouds stretching across the horizon, under a deep blue sky. The view highlights Greenland's dramatic, icy landscape and its stark contrast between land, ice, and ocean." />

<img src="/assets/20250519-greenland2.jpg" alt="The image shows another aerial view of Greenland taken from an airplane window. The wing and engine of the Icelandair aircraft are clearly visible in the foreground, with the airline's logo on the wingtip. Below, a vast expanse of sea ice stretches across the lower half of the scene, while snow-capped mountains and rugged coastal terrain appear in the distance. The clouds are layered in soft, horizontal bands, and the sky above is a deep, clear blue. The image captures the stark, frozen beauty of Greenland’s landscape from high altitude." />

That's it! That's all the fun stuff. Nobody wants to see photos of me after a 7 hour flight or collecting luggage or waiting for an Uber. Thanks for following my journey!
