Merry Christmas! Another Christmas where we wake up in a hotel room. Last year was at the Contemporary at Disney World. This year is somewhere between Grand Cayman and Aruba.

Santa made it aboard and was handing out presents and taking photos this morning in the grand foyer, though the logistics of him arriving on this tiny dot, unseen, in the middle of the Caribbean Sea are suspect. Hmmm. 

I've been impressed by how some families have adapted their Christmas traditions to ship travel. One family had a dedicated suitcase of wrapped presents and had taken the little nook next to the Deck 14 lounge to open them. Another family had set up in the library. In both cases the kids were younger, I'd say no older than 8. It was nice they were able to bring that ritual with them. We, on the other hand, did presents at home two nights before we left. 

Son's foot situation continues to improve. Today he's able to put some weight on the foot now, though we're still being cautious. In the meantime he's discovered the US version of The Office and has been binging that while recuperating. 

Wife and daughter made new friends today, an extended family on vacation from Quebec. They met down at the Santa event and then went upstairs and shared lunch together. Later, daughter went with them to a show. I'm glad to see that relationship develop. 

Lastly, I found a nice writing spot here at the aft of the ship. It's a mob scene here during breakfast and lunch, and fairly peaceful in the late afternoon and evening. This open-air spot wouldn't have been all that pleasant on the Iceland voyage but suits me just fine on this one.
