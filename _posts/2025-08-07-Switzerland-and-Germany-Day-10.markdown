- **Start of day:** Garmisch-Partenkirchen, Germany

We had a lazy day today. Rowan slept in late and I read on the balcony for much of the morning. Our balcony is great until mid-afternoon when the sun comes around. 

For lunch we made our way down the street to [L'Osteria Garmisch Marienplatz](https://losteria.net/de-en/restaurants/restaurant/garmisch-marienplatz/), where I managed to polish off half of a pizza much larger than I expected, and Rowan got the lasagna which he unfortunately burned his finger on. (It was fine an hour later, luckily)

In the afternoon we went down to Lidl next to the train station, about a 10 minute walk each way, to stock up on some Cokes[^1] and snacks. I liked this building along the way:

At dinnertime, we considered eating at our hotel:

But instead opted to return to [Bungalow 7](https://www.bungalow-7.de/en//) so Rowan could get the fish & chips again. I opted for baby back ribs and Caesar salad, which were both great. I feel lucky we found this restaurant and that it was so close to our hotel.

On the topic of the hotel, it's a good property. It feels like an older property that has been through a successful remodel. Some areas, such as the stairwell, appear older and in a more traditional style. The rooms themselves have modern ACs and controls, with updated windows and patio door. Our balcony faces into a courtyard with an obtuse angle so you can sort of see other people if they're sitting out on their balconies, but still much better than the deck fishbowl we have at home. The hotel property sits on a corner of two well-trafficked roads and I think noise might be more of an issue if we were facing one of those. The location is great with many shops and restaurants just a few blocks away on the main street.

Since tomorrow would be the last day we could cancel our Munich accomodations, I spent some time researching other options. Not that I'm unhappy on paper with what I've picked ([Mercure Hotel München Altstadt](https://all.accor.com/hotel/3709/index.en.shtml)), but I wanted to see if there were other neighborhoods in Munich that might be more our speed. Having compared ratings and prices for a lot of hotels around Munich, I still feel like we're well positioned. The hotel is more basic than our Garmisch one but the location and reviews seem great. It'll probably be more like the Appenzell place, which reminded me of the [Drei Koenige in Lucerne](https://www.drei-koenige.ch/de) my dad and I stayed in in 2023. Perfectly serviceable, but probably won't be attracting any Instagram influencers.

Oh, and of course I had a side quest earlier today to find CPAP water.
