Today was a sea day as we navigate from Fort Lauderdale to our first stop Grand Cayman.

Son is dealing with the implications of his injury better than I would've expected, though he's still having periodic waves of emotions over missed opportunities. I'm trying to be very supportive, pointing out that many of his plans don't change simply because it takes him longer to get from place to place. He can still eat his favorite foods. He can still sit upstairs for a bit and work on his tan. Plus, all this crutch work is probably good for his shoulders (glass half full).

I can see him struggling to push his mind past all the negatives, with some success.

We'll have a better idea in a few days when he tries to put weight on his ankle exactly where we stand.[^1]

I aim to get out of the room before 8 most days (more usually 7:00-7:30) so that I have a lot of choice in where to go where there won't be a lot of people and I can grab some decent photos of us coming into port. I have 2-3 coffees, get a nice caffeine buzz going, and try to knock out some early writing. Success is mixed. But at least the weather and sceneary are spectacular more often than not!

The rest of the cabin are late risers.

Sea days are sea days. Too much laying around and eating, not enough planned activites. It is what it is. Sunset was somewhat redeeming.

And I'm including this photo as the cloud kind of looks like a [partially constructed Death Star](https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Death_Star_II) on the horizon:

Tomorrow is Georgetown, Grand Cayman. We visited three years ago, plus it's a tender stop, so we'll stay on the ship and enjoy the extra space.
