My stupid, **stupid** CPAP machine kept cutting out on me last night. I've had it since April 2018 and in all that time it's had this quirk where you have to get the plug _just right_ into the back of it, or else it's unpowered. Sometimes in the night you can accidentally move the CPAP a little and it'll stop working and start actively suffocating you. Last night was an epidemic of not being able to get it to stay plugged in right. _That's not super fun travel information, I know; it's more a reminder to myself to actually deal with the situation at some point._

Today was my planned day for a Big Hike. Because of the sleep problems I was really dragging this morning. I managed to wander down to the grocery store at 10:30 and pick up a pastry for breakfast, along with a large water to take with me on the hike.[^1]

I bought a new day pack from REI before the trip -- the [Gregory Miko 20](https://www.rei.com/product/218012/gregory-miko-20-pack-mens) -- and so far I'm pleased with it. I haven't yet figured out the ideal spots for all my stuff, but it has plenty of spots to put it. I packed up some hiking essentials and then headed out around 11:30.

Today's hike was the [Balestrand Forest Hike](https://www.alltrails.com/trail/norway/vestland/balestrand-skogstur). I can't recall now how I chose Balestrand as a destination, but once I did, I had this hike scoped out. It starts basically right at my hotel and loops all the way back. The elevation gain, ~1700ft, is comparable to [one of the Rancho San Antonio](https://www.alltrails.com/trail/us/california/pge-trail-upper-high-meadow-and-upper-rogue-valley-loop) (Cupertino area) hikes I've done in the past, and I consider myself in better hiking shape now than then, so I wasn't concerned with the vertical. It's 5.2 miles, well within what I'd been training in North Carolina.

I did the trail clockwise. The first quarter of the hike is easy along roads heading out of town toward the trail part of the hike. The second quarter is challenging. There's a lot of elevation gain in a short amount of time, over a lot of roots, and a fair bit of questioning whether I was actually still on the trail. About halfway through this section I was deeply thankful I took the trail clockwide instead of counter. I could see myself taking a downhill tumble in this area. The trail continues on, finally reaching some scenic vistas and a few points of interest. By the time I'd reached the highest part of the trail, I'd encountered exactly one person. For the second half of the hike, I ran into 5 or 6 sets of hikers who were doing an out-and-back from the other direction. With the benefit of hindsight, this is what I'd do the next time as well. That second half of the trail is much more well maintained.

I'll let the photos and videos speak for themselves.

The ground is scattered with small rocks and surrounded by patches of green moss and forest undergrowth. A yellow trail marker is painted on one of the tree trunks along the path, indicating a marked hiking route. Sunlight filters through the trees, creating a mix of light and shadow on the forest floor. The scene is peaceful and natural, suggesting a popular area for hiking or nature walks." />

The sign indicates the location is Sandsstølen, situated at 180 meters above sea level. The top sign is weathered, with engraved text. Below it is a wooden-framed information board with a laminated notice, and directional arrows pointing toward Skasheim (1.9 km) and Kræklingen (1.3 km). A green metal box, likely a trail register or suggestion box, is mounted beneath the signpost. In the background, there are green shrubs, tall trees, and snow-capped mountains under a partly sunny blue sky. A rustic wooden bench is positioned beside the sign, suggesting a resting point for hikers." />

Along the way I came across an interesting shelter called [Balabu](https://www.vestlandfylke.no/idrett-og-friluftsliv/dagsturhytta/balestrand-balabu/). This is a "Dagsturhytta" -- a day-trip cabin -- that are open to all. I had a look around the outside but skipped going in. I could see this being such a cozy structure to stop at with some friends.

The cabin is painted dark brown or black and features a steep triangular roof with a chimney and a wraparound deck with a wooden railing. The structure includes open areas with seating and appears to be designed for hikers or visitors to rest and enjoy the view.

The setting is peaceful, surrounded by evergreens and natural greenery." />

Mounted on the cabin wall next to a glass door are two signs. The upper sign has a simple line drawing of a cabin and the name 'Balabu' along with logos of supporting organizations. The lower sign, in Norwegian, reads 'Vi takkar det norske folk for bidraget' and 'Spelemidlar har gjort det mogleg å reise dette anlegget', which translates to 'We thank the Norwegian people for their contribution' and 'Lottery funds made it possible to build this facility'. It is branded with the logo of Norsk Tipping, Norway’s national lottery. Inside, part of a wooden bench and table is visible through the glass door, and there is a broom leaning against the wall nearby." />

I treated the trail as a loop, taking it clockwise starting from my hotel in town and heading south before turning west for the trail. From the beginning of the non-road part of the path until I reached the benches at the overlook, around 2.5 miles or so in, I only encountered one other person. From the benches back down to town, I passed maybe 14 people. Clearly doing the in-and-out was the more popular route, and if I were to do the trail again in the future, that's what I'd suggest. The first half of my hike just wasn't all that fun: trail poorly marked in many places, very steep sections, some hiking on logging roads, etc. The second half was much better. Live and learn.

After the hike I showered and returned to [Pearl by Harbor](https://www.instagram.com/pearl_by_harbor/) for the salmon and mashed potatoes again, which, again, was excellent. I picked up some snacks at the Coop and nursed my wobbly legs in the room for the rest of the afternoon.

In the evening I went down to [Baalee Restaurant](https://g.co/kgs/mQVZHDW) again to have their Bergen Soup but they weren't serving it tonight! There was some negotiating with the owner, but ultimately I was looking for something lighter than what they had available, so I returned to the Kviknes Hotel and had lobster bisque in their bar for dinner. 

I hadn't yet figured out tomorrow's route plan to Voss, so I spent more than an hour on the laptop working through different scenarios and pros and cons of each. After a lot of switching back and forth between [Norled](https://www.norled.no/) (ferries), [Vy](https://www.vy.no/en) (mostly trains, some buses), and [Skyss](https://www.skyss.no/en/tickets-and-prices/buying-tickets/) (different things but mostly buses?), I finally settled on an itinerary that is 1) the fastest, 2) the cheapest, and 3) the least convenient (in that it starts at 7:50am and arrives in my target city at 10:30am, well before check-in). My challenge was that the fastest and best modes of travel only ran twice a day: too early (7:50am) or too late (4:30pm). All the routes at more reasonable, mid-day times were hours longer -- and not in a good, well-that-will-be-a-scenic-adventure kind of way. At one point I had my eyes on an express ferry to Flåm and then a train to Voss, but that would've run over $100 US. My plan, short ferry plus direct bus, runs about $16 total.

[^1]: I tried, and failed, to avoid buying carbonated water, or Water With Gas. There was one bottle that looked bubbly, and a different type of bottle next to it that didn't have bubbles in it. My fun surprise mid-hike was that I still somehow bought carbonated water.
