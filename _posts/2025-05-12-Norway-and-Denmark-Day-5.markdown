My stupid, **stupid** CPAP machine kept cutting out on me last night. I've had it since April 2018 and in all that time it's had this quirk where you have to get the plug _just right_ into the back of it, or else it's unpowered. Sometimes in the night you can accidentally move the CPAP a little and it'll stop working and start actively suffocating you. Last night was an epidemic of not being able to get it to stay plugged in right. That's not super fun travel information, I know; it's more a reminder to myself to actually deal with the situation at some point. 

Today was my planned day for a Big Hike. Because of the sleep problems I was really dragging this morning. I managed to wander down to the grocery store at 10:30 and pick up a pastry for breakfast, along with a large water to take with me on the hike.[^1]

I bought a new day pack from REI before the trip -- the [Gregory Miko 20](https://www.rei.com/product/218012/gregory-miko-20-pack-mens) -- and so far I'm pleased with it. I haven't yet figured out the ideal spots for all my stuff, but it has plenty of spots to put it. I packed up some hiking essentials and then headed out around 11:30.

Today's hike was the [Balestrand Forest Hike](https://www.alltrails.com/trail/norway/vestland/balestrand-skogstur). I can't recall now how I chose Balestrand as a destination, but once I did, I had this hike scoped out. It starts basically right at my hotel and loops all the way back. The elevation gain, ~1700ft, is comparable to [one of the Rancho San Antonio](https://www.alltrails.com/trail/us/california/pge-trail-upper-high-meadow-and-upper-rogue-valley-loop) (Cupertino area) hikes I've done in the past, and I consider myself in better hiking shape now than then, so I wasn't concerned with the vertical. It's 5.2 miles, well within what I'd been training in North Carolina.

I did the trail clockwise. The first quarter of the hike is easy, as it's roads heading out of town to the trail part of the hike. The second quarter is challenging. There's a lot of elevation gain in a short amount of time, over a lot of roots, and a fair bit of questioning whether I was actually still on the trail. About halfway through this section I was deeply thankful I took the trail clockwide instead of counter. I could see myself taking a downhill tumble in this area. The trail continues on, finally reaching some scenic vistas and a few points of interest. By the time I'd reached the highest part of the trail, I'd encountered exactly one person. For the second half of the hike, I ran into 5 or 6 sets of hikers who were doing an out-and-back from the other direction. With the benefit of hindsight, this is what I'd do the next time as well. That second half of the trail is much more well maintained.

I'll let the photos and videos speak for themselves.

After the hike I showered and returned to [Pearl by Harbor](https://www.instagram.com/pearl_by_harbor/) for the salmon and mashed potatoes again, which, again, was excellent. I picked up some snacks at the Coop and nursed my wobbly legs in the room for the rest of the afternoon.

In the evening I went down to [Baalee Restaurant](https://g.co/kgs/mQVZHDW) again to have their Bergen Soup but they weren't serving it tonight! There was some negotiating with the owner, but ultimately I was looking for something lighter than they had available, so I came back to the Kviknes Hotel and had lobster bisque for dinner. 

I hadn't figured out transportation for the next day, so I spent more than an hour on the laptop working through different scenarios and pros and cons of each. After a lot of switching back and forth between [Norled](https://www.norled.no/) (ferries), [Vy](https://www.vy.no/en) (mostly trains, some buses), and [Skyss](https://www.skyss.no/en/tickets-and-prices/buying-tickets/) (different things but mostly buses?), I finally settled on an itinerary that is 1) the fastest, 2) the cheapest, and 3) the least convenient (in that it starts at 7:50am and arrives in my target city at 10:30am, well before check-in). My challenge was that the fastest and best modes of travel only ran twice a day: too early (7:50am) or too late (4:30pm). All the routes at more reasonable, mid-day times were hours longer -- and not in a good, well-that-will-be-a-scenic-adventure kind of way. At one point I had my eyes on an express ferry to Fl√•m and then a train to Voss, but that would've run over $100 US. My plan, short ferry plus direct bus, runs about $16 total.
