Here’s a bunch of stuff about me.

1\. I’m anxious about touching metal in the wintertime for fear of shocking myself. I close car doors by touching only the glass.   
2\. My first computer was an Apple //e with one floppy; I eventually added a 10 **meg** hard drive an 300 baud modem.   
3\. I lived in a house with no central A/C. This is an odd notion for most Floridians, I know.  
4\. I’m an expert in installing those wireframe closet organization systems now.  
5\. I used to have two cars: one for Tampa and one for New Jersey.   
6\. I’ve been on quite the pad thai kick lately.   
7\. I’m a sucker for salmon. Love it.   
8\. [Here is my about.me page](http://about.me/bbhart.com).   
9\. I have several characters in World of Warcraft that I miss sometimes.  
10\. My finance degree hasn’t helped me much in my career, but I appreciate the way it taught me to think.  
11\. I have a very dry sense of humor.  
12\. High school was a decent experience; I didn’t experience much teenage angst.   
13\. I couldn’t act if my life depended on it. I’d rather sing in front of 2000 people than deliver one line acting.   
14\. I had close to 400,000 frequent flier miles at one point. I used 1/2 of them to fly me and my wife to Europe in business class for vacation.  
15\. I’m a classic [left-brain person](http://www.funderstanding.com/brain/left-brain-learning/).  
16\. I lived on a cruise ship for eight months.   
17\. I’ve never watched the Rocky Horror Picture Show all the way through.   
18\. It’s time to banish all pennies… round transactions to the nearest 5¢!   
19\. I have lots of wireless devices in my house: two thermostats, MacBook Air, iMac, Dell desktop, Dell laptop, Brother print/fax/scan, XBOX 360, Wii, TiVo HD, iPhone 5, iPhone 4S, iPad 3, and iPhone 4 (for music).   
20\. Cooking entertains me. As someone that pushes bits for a living, it gives me a chance to create something _tangible_ for a change.  
21\. Despite growing up in Florida, I’ve never set foot in Alabama or Louisiana, two of our nearby neighbors.  
22\. When I was in Grade 6 I was cast as an extra in Disney’s The Parent Trap 2 and made $70. Yes, you can clearly see me in the movie.  
23\. The foreign language I’d most like to learn is French. Italian is a close second.   
24\. New Zealand looks like an interesting place to visit.   
25\. When I was a teenager I spent the night on a [submarine tender](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Submarine_tender).   
26\. Shaving two days in a row is… _problematic_. My skin stages a revolt.

28\. The quality of my handwriting is degrading as I get older.   
29\. I ran a BBS for about five years, and was the [FidoNet](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FidoNet) admin for Tampa for awhile.   
30\. There’s nothing like commuting to make you loath your fellow man.   
31\. Ikea is one of the few shopping experiences I can tolerate. It might be because they serve salmon there (see #7).  
32\. The amount of trivial knowledge in my brain outweights the useful info by about 4:1.   
33\. I’m a licensed real estate agent in the state of Florida and a REALTOR™.

36\. 5 or 6 hours is my upper limit for a car trip. Anything longer than that, I try to fly.   
37\. I am not on any prescribed medication. I’m not on any nonprescribed medication, for that matter.  
38\. Mosquitos _love_ me. My ankles are especially attractive.  
39\. [Joe Kosinski](http://www.imdb.com/name/nm2676052/) introduced me to the Internet way back in late 1993. I was the 45th person at [UCF](http://ucf.edu/) to get an Internet account.  
40\. Blue is my favorite color.
