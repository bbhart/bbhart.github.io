- **Start of day:** Voss, Norway ([Scandic Voss](https://www.scandichotels.com/en/hotels/scandic-voss))
- **End of day:** Oslo, Norway ([Clarion Hotel Oslo](https://www.strawberry.no/hotell/norge/oslo/clarion-hotel-oslo))

Today I'm taking the [Bergensbanen train service](https://www.vy.no/en/traffic-and-routes/stations-and-network-maps/the-bergen-line) that runs between Bergen and Oslo. In my case I'm picking it up about an hour and 15 minutes into its journey east out of Bergen, since I'm joining in Voss.

The train wasn't until 1:03pm so I had some time to kill in the morning. I slept in late, checked out of the hotel around 11:45am, then basically just chilled on the train platform. It was yet another in a series of beautiful days, with temps in the high 50's -- which, YES, seem like it would be chilly -- but with the sun out it was sublime. 

I sat on that platform for 75 minutes with nothing to do. As my train was pulling in, I happened to notice blood on my hand, which usually isn't the case. Turns out I've scraped my knee somehow, somewhere, and now there's a noticable amount of blood there (and on my hand). Did I notice in the 75 minutes of boredom leading up to this? Nope. Only once the train was pulling in and it was go time. I hustled to get into my suitcase, into the day pack stashed inside my suitcase, to find some tissues to tidy myself up as people are boarding. I get cleaned up enough not to make a spectacle of myself while boarding the train and getting situated. But COME ON, universe. 

I found my seat, on the righthand side when heading Bergen to Oslo, and settled in for the 6+ hour journey. There's not a lot of narrative to provide. Instead, enjoy some of these photos and videos.

Lots of variations in the biomes along the route:

I'm always a sucker for meatballs and mashed potatoes, even in a train dining car. Not bad!

We arrived late into Oslo, so the whole trip from Voss was 1:03pm to 7:20pm or so. As you might expect for a rail line that needs to dodge mountains and fjords and follows rivers a lot of the way, there are a lot of curves, so by 5:00pm or so I was ready to be done. The variety of scenery, though, was amazing to look at.

Once finally at Oslo, it was a short walk from the central Oslo Station (Oslo S) to the Clarion Oslo hotel where I'm staying.

It's too many pillows!

I hadn't really _done_ anything all day but was glad to get into my room and unwind a little. I end up downing a burrito bowl at a place called El Camino near the hotel, which hit the spot. I walked around near the hotel in the evening, and was particularly taken by the Opera House, as you might tell.
