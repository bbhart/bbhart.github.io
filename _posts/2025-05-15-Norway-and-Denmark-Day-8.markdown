Today I'm taking the Bergensbanen train service that runs between Bergen and Oslo. In my case I'm picking it up about an hour and 15 minutes into its journey east out of Bergen, since I'm joining in Voss.

The train wasn't until 1:03pm so I had some time to kill in the morning. I slept in late, checked out of the hotel around 11:45, then basically just chilled on the train platform. It was yet another in a series of beautiful days, with temps in the high 50's -- which, YES, seem like it would be chilly -- but with the sun out it was sublime. 

I sat on that platform with 75 minutes with nothing to do. As the train was pulling in, I happened to notice blood on my hand, which usually isn't the case. Turns out I've scraped my knee somehow, and now there's a noticable amount of blood there (and my hand). Did I notice in the 75 minutes of boredom leading up to this? Nope. Only once the train was pulling in. I hustled to get into my suitcase, into the day pack stashed inside my suitcase, to find some tissues to clean myself up as people are boarding. I get tidied up enough not to make a spectacle of myself while boarding the train and getting situated.

I find my seat, on the righthand side when heading Bergen to Oslo, and settle in for the 6+ hour journey. There's not a lot of narrative to provide. Instead, enjoy some of these photos and videos.

It's a short walk from the central Oslo Station (Oslo S) to the Clarion Oslo hotel where I'm staying. I haven't been _doing_ anything all day but I'm glad to get into my room and unwind a little. I end up downing a burrito bowl at El Camino near the hotel, which hits the spot. I walk around near the hotel in the evening and then turn in early to read.
