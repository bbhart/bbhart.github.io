- **Start of day:** Voss, Norway ([Scandic Voss](https://www.scandichotels.com/en/hotels/scandic-voss))
- **End of day:** Oslo, Norway ([Clarion Hotel Oslo](https://www.strawberry.no/hotell/norge/oslo/clarion-hotel-oslo))

Today I'm taking the [Bergensbanen train service](https://www.vy.no/en/traffic-and-routes/stations-and-network-maps/the-bergen-line) that runs between Bergen and Oslo. In my case I'm picking it up about an hour and 15 minutes into its journey east out of Bergen, since I'm joining in Voss.

The train wasn't until 1:03pm so I had some time to kill in the morning. I slept in late, checked out of the hotel around 11:45am, then basically just chilled on the train platform. It was yet another in a series of beautiful days, with temps in the high 50's -- which, YES, seem like it would be chilly -- but with the sun out it was sublime. 

I sat on that platform for 75 minutes with nothing to do. As my train was pulling in, I happened to notice blood on my hand, which usually isn't the case. Turns out I've scraped my knee somehow, somewhere, and now there's a noticable amount of blood there (and on my hand). Did I notice in the 75 minutes of boredom leading up to this? Nope. Only once the train was pulling in and it was go time. I hustled to get into my suitcase, into the day pack stashed inside my suitcase, to find some tissues to tidy myself up as people are boarding. I get cleaned up enough not to make a spectacle of myself while boarding the train and getting situated. But COME ON, universe. 

I found my seat, on the righthand side when heading Bergen to Oslo, and settled in for the 6+ hour journey. There's not a lot of narrative to provide. Instead, enjoy some of these photos and videos.

My lonely suitcase waiting for my 1:03pm train:
<img src="/assets/20250515-voss-platform.jpg" alt="The image shows a sunny day at a train station in Voss, Norway. The platform is quiet, with a few people sitting on benches, some wearing high-visibility work clothing. A black suitcase and a black bag rest on one of the metal benches in the foreground. Overhead wires and poles line the tracks, and signs with platform numbers are visible. To the left, traditional buildings with steep, shingled roofs stand beside the platform. In the background, there is a lush green hillside dotted with white houses, and a clear blue sky stretches above the mountainous landscape." />

Along the train route:
<img src="/assets/20250515-train1.jpg" alt="The image shows a fast-flowing turquoise river winding through a rocky forested valley. Trees with light green spring foliage cover both sides of the valley, and sunlight filters through the clear blue sky above. In the background, snow-covered mountain peaks rise above the tree line, creating a dramatic contrast with the lush greenery below. The water appears clear and vibrant, with visible white rapids forming over submerged rocks. This scenic landscape is along the Bergensbanen railway between Voss and Oslo in Norway." />

Lots of variations in the biomes along the route:
<img src="/assets/20250515-train2.jpg" alt="The image shows a vast mountainous landscape mostly covered in snow under a clear blue sky. Patches of dark brown and black rock break through the snow in irregular patterns, especially on the slopes and ridges. Gentle hills and rounded peaks stretch across the scene, with little to no visible vegetation. A narrow road or railway track can be faintly seen winding through the lower part of the image. This wintry scene is part of the high-altitude terrain along the Bergensbanen train route between Voss and Oslo in Norway." />

I'm always a sucker for meatballs and mashed potatoes, even in a train dining car. Not bad!
<img src="/assets/20250515-train3.jpg" alt="The image shows a meal served on a round disposable plate, likely made of compostable material, placed on a table beside a window. The meal consists of three meatballs covered in brown gravy, a portion of mashed potatoes topped with herbs, and a scoop of yellow pea puree or mushy peas. A wooden fork is held above the plate, ready to eat. The food is attractively arranged, and the setting suggests it's being enjoyed in the dining car of a train, with part of a tiled platform or sidewalk visible through the window." />

We arrived late into Oslo, so the whole trip from Voss was 1:03pm to 7:20pm or so. As you might expect for a rail line that needs to dodge mountains and fjords and follows rivers a lot of the way, there are a lot of curves, so by 5:00pm or so I was ready to be done. The variety of scenery, though, was amazing to look at.

Once finally at Oslo, it was a short walk from the central Oslo Station (Oslo S) to the Clarion Oslo hotel where I'm staying.

<img src="/assets/20250515-oslo-clarion1.jpg" alt="The image shows a modern hotel room at the Clarion Oslo, located near the main train station. The room features a large bed with white linens, dark gray bedding, and several pillows, including two in a burnt orange color. Behind the bed is a tall, padded black headboard that spans the width of the wall. Floor-to-ceiling curtains cover a large window or balcony door, allowing soft daylight to filter in. A flat-screen TV is mounted on the left wall above a long, curved black console table. On the table are a lamp, a tray with a kettle and cups, and some other amenities. The flooring is light wood, and a chair and small desk are partially visible on the right side of the image. The overall style is minimalist and contemporary." />

The bed has a dark padded headboard and is neatly made with white linens, a dark gray blanket, and four accent pillows—two in a bold orange-red and two in a lighter patterned shade. A note or card is placed on the blanket. To the right of the bed is an open wardrobe with a hanger and shelf space, next to a compact desk area with a maroon surface, a curved mirror, and a soft gray chair. The walls are light, the floor is a light wood, and the room has a clean, minimalist Scandinavian design. A small trash bin sits near the wall by the door." />

It's too many pillows!
<img src="/assets/20250515-oslo-clarion3.jpg" alt="The image shows a close-up of the bed in the same room at the Clarion Oslo, focusing on the pillows. There is an abundance of pillows arranged at the head of the bed, including two large white sleeping pillows and at least four decorative ones in shades of orange and textured fabric. A small bottle of Coca-Cola is placed upright beside the pillows, and a coiled cord—possibly from a CPAP machine or similar device—rests on the bed. A reading light attached to the headboard illuminates the scene, casting soft shadows on the crisp white bedding." />

I hadn't really _done_ anything all day but was glad to get into my room and unwind a little. I end up downing a burrito bowl at a place called El Camino near the hotel, which hit the spot. I walked around near the hotel in the evening, and was particularly taken by the Opera House, as you might tell.

 <img src="/assets/20250515-oslo1.jpg" alt="The image shows a scenic urban view in downtown Oslo, taken from a pedestrian bridge over a canal or river. On the left side, there are modern red-brick apartment buildings with balconies, next to a grassy area and a wooden walkway along the water where people are sitting and enjoying the outdoors. In the background, the strikingly angled building of the Munch Museum stands out with its unique leaning design. To the right is a large modern white building, part of the Oslo Opera House complex, with a Ferris wheel partially visible behind it. The bridge ahead carries cars and pedestrians, and the water reflects the clear blue sky above. The area appears clean, modern, and lively." />

<img src="/assets/20250515-oslo-opera1.jpg" alt="The image shows the Oslo Opera House in the evening, viewed from a low angle on its sloped marble roof. The building's large glass façade is brightly lit from within, revealing the curved wooden interior and colorful horizontal lighting that glows in warm shades of orange and red. The sky is a deep blue, indicating twilight or early nightfall. In the background, a lit Ferris wheel adds a festive element, and a few people are visible enjoying the public space. The architecture is modern and striking, with clean lines and a strong geometric presence." />

<img src="/assets/20250515-oslo-opera2.jpg" alt="The image shows a minimalist and dramatic view from the roof of the Oslo Opera House at dusk. The large white stone wall of the building dominates the left side of the frame, with its subtle textured surface catching the soft evening light. The rest of the image reveals the expansive sloped rooftop stretching toward the horizon, with a narrow line of silhouetted people in the distance. The sky is a deepening blue, fading into warm orange tones near the horizon, with a band of low, evenly spaced clouds adding depth. Two dome-like structures can be seen on the far right, adding contrast to the smooth architecture. The scene is quiet and serene." />

<img src="/assets/20250515-oslo-opera3.jpg" alt="The image captures a beautiful evening view from the roof of the Oslo Opera House, looking out toward the Oslo waterfront. The sloped marble walkway leads downward, lined with soft, warm lights along the low stone wall. To the right, part of the building’s angular structure extends outward. Across the calm water, the buildings along the harbor are softly illuminated, with their lights reflecting on the surface. The sky glows with the last light of sunset, transitioning from deep blue to warm orange near the horizon, and streaked with a layer of low clouds. The overall atmosphere is peaceful and inviting."/>
