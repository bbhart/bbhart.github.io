- **Start of day:** Marienplatz, Munich, Germany
- **End of day:** Hilton Munich Airport, Munich, Germany

We hit the travel wall, where we've had a great time but are ready to be home. We're both more tuned to the town or village kind of experience. It's unfortunate that we hit our wall in Munich, as it seems like an interesting city that we just weren't able to explore thoroughly. I wonder how different our experiences would've been if we'd started in Munich instead of ending. 

The original plan was to stay at this Mercure hotel for 3 nights but I ended up booking a room at the Hilton Munich Airport for the last night. We checked out of the Mercure and took the S-bahn out to the Munich airport station.

After checking in early, I spent the next 30 minutes trying to find a sushi spot that Google Maps insisted existed called EAT HAPPY. It ended up being a stall in a grocery store; nowhere was this mentioned. My tenacity paid off, though, as it filled me up for 14 euros. I ended up [writing a review](https://www.google.com/maps/reviews/@48.3546166,11.7879375,691m/data=!3m2!1e3!4b1!4m6!14m5!1m4!2m3!1sCi9DQUlRQUNvZENodHljRjlvT25CMVNteHRjREJSYTA5SVRFZzFkRVpZY2xaemQzYxAB!2m1!1s0x0:0x6183c142122e7d01?hl=en-US&entry=ttu&g_ep=EgoyMDI1MTAwOC4wIKXMDSoASAFQAw%3D%3D) to help future travelers find the place.

The rest of the afternoon was pretty lazy.  Rowan played games in the room and I walked around the airport, half to kill time and get steps in, half to scope out where we'd check in tomorrow. In the early evening, we had an excellent final night meal at the [Mountain Hub Gourmet restaurant](https://gourmet.mountainhub.de/en/) in our Hilton.

Tomorrow: we fly.
