Sea day 2 between St. John's and Greenland.

**Today is Rowan's birthday!**  We had a great dinner at [Le Petit Chef](https://www.celebritycruises.com/things-to-do-onboard/eat-and-drink/restaurants-and-cafes/le-petit-chef-at-qsine) to celebrate. Before the first course they put on a show about the history of tomatoes, and then presented a tomato-oriented appetizer. Next, a show about the history of art, followed by a shrimp and cucumber thing (ok so that one doesn't match). Then the main course and dessert. The show part was clever, truly. The food was main restaurant quality, with the main course being a step up. Rowan sucked down three Shirley Temples and then a (chalky) chocolate birthday cake.

Frankly I can't recall much else about the day, as I try to write this the day after. The sea days are running together. Fortunately the kids have some friends now. Sherri and I don't, but that's status quo.
