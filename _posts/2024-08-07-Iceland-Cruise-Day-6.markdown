Sea day == sleep in day

I managed 9 hours of sleep according to my CPAP. Sherri and I started our wanderings around 8:30 this morning, grabbing a light breakfast and then finding chairs to read on for awhile. We finally convinced the kids to get up around noon, then we headed for lunch. 

It's another overcast, gray day. Winds aren't too bad and temperatures are in the mid-60's. After the heat of NYC and Holly Springs, I don't mind. It would be good to see the sun again, though.

_Where do we live, Siena?_

Since there's not much to report for sea days, let's talk about the overall cruising experience. I may be running out of patience for the near-constant sales pitches, nickel-and-diming, and gouging. Premium (acceptabie) Internet for 1 device for the whole voyage runs $400+. If you're a drinker, the base drinks package runs $84/day. Per person. And if you have multiple adults in the same room they require all the adults to buy the package. If you don't get a drink package and would like to a la carte the occasional NA beer, those cost $11 each. They do have a Zero Alcohol package that gets you premium coffee, juices, sodas, and NA cocktails; that's $45/day. The least expensive short excursions in Greenland and Iceland run to hundreds of dollars per person; you could easily spend $1000 for one excursion for a family of four. We will pay close to $1000 for mandatory gratuities. Something that's new to me: if you want room service, it's $10 plus gratuity. I truly don't mind spending for nice things but what's fuzzy here is the sense that you're getting value for your dollar. 

The ship itself is showing its age, despite a refurb in 2017-18. Paint on metal that's been coated on too many times. Scratches and scrapes in staterooms that make everything feel well-worn. The public areas seem nice, though.
