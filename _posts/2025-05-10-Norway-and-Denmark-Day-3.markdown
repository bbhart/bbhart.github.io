- **End of day:** Bergen, Norway ([Hotel Park](https://www.hotelpark.no/))

I start the day after a **huge** sleep, logging almost 9 hours on the CPAP. One would like to believe my jet lag has been remedied and my internal clock has been reset. [Spoiler: nope.]

As I mentioned at the end of yesterday, I intentionally booked a walking tour for this first full day in Bergen, to get me up and moving earlier than perhaps my body wanted to. I skipped hotel breakfast and casually made my way through downtown Bergen:

<img src="/assets/20250510-bergen1.jpg" alt="The image shows a picturesque town square with cobblestone pavement, surrounded by colorful historic buildings with European architectural styles. In the center of the square is a statue of a person standing on a pedestal, enclosed by a decorative green fence. The buildings display signs for various businesses, including an optician ('Briller-Kontaktlinser') and other shops. In the background, there is a green, tree-covered hillside dotted with small houses. The sky is clear and blue, and a few people are walking in the square, along with a white van parked nearby. The scene is bright and sunny." />

Arriving at over to the [Bryggens Museum](https://bymuseet.no/museum/bryggens-museum/?lang=en) next to the waterfront for my scheduled tour:

<img src="/assets/20250510-bergen3.jpg" alt="The image shows the entrance to Bryggens Museum, a museum dedicated to medieval archaeological collections, as indicated by the large text on the building's exterior wall. The building is modern, with textured concrete walls and large windows. In front of the entrance, there are two display signs: one is a tall black pillar with museum information, and the other is a red sandwich board welcoming visitors in multiple languages, including Norwegian, English, French, Spanish, Italian, Arabic, and others. A small potted plant is placed near the glass entrance doors. The surrounding area is clean, with brick paving and some greenery in the background. The sky is clear and blue." />

Our group for the tour was unique. There were only six of us[^1], and the other five people were all together -- an older, blind couple; their two guides; and one other person with them. I ended up speaking with the couple quite a bit once they learned I was American and interested in Norway and its history, as they were both Norwegian. 

The tour itself was fascinating! Not to spoil it for you but: there were lots of fires. I mean, they built with wood and all. Each time there was a fire, they built a little bit closer to the water. And, as you might imagine, they took lots of precautions to avoid future fires. Our tour guide described all of this in a much more engrossing way, naturally.

<img src="/assets/20250510-bergen2.jpg" alt="The image shows a large, historic stone church with Romanesque architectural features. It has thick stone walls, small arched windows, and two prominent square towers at the front. The entrance is marked by an ornate arched doorway with decorative carvings. The building is surrounded by a grassy area with a stone pathway leading to the entrance. A few old gravestones or monuments are visible on the lawn. The sky is clear and blue, and the scene is framed by leafy green trees." />

<img src="/assets/20250510-bergen4.jpg" alt="The image shows a group of people inside a modern building with exposed concrete ceilings and hanging lights. A woman in a bright red dress, wearing glasses, is speaking and gesturing energetically with both hands raised, appearing to guide or explain something to the group. Other people are standing around her, listening. One woman in the foreground wears a casual outfit with a long jacket and glasses, while a man in a short-sleeve shirt is looking down at something. The environment looks like a public space, possibly a cultural center, museum, or auditorium, with railings, glass partitions, and a spacious, multi-level interior." />

<img src="/assets/20250510-bergen5.jpg" alt="The image shows a group of people gathered in a narrow, historic street lined with traditional wooden buildings. A woman in a red dress is leading the group, standing in front of an old whitewashed stone or plaster building with a wooden door and multi-pane window above it. She appears to be giving a tour or explaining something about the location. The street is paved with cobblestones, and to the right, there are tall, mustard-colored wooden buildings with steep roofs and wooden beams, typical of old European harbor districts. Other visitors can be seen further down the alley. The scene is brightly lit by sunlight, suggesting a clear day." />

<img src="/assets/20250510-bergen6.jpg" alt="The image shows a small courtyard surrounded by old stone and wooden buildings with tiled roofs. One building has a red wooden extension above a large wooden door, supported by beams. The walls of the buildings are whitewashed with small windows and arched doorways, giving the area a historical appearance. There are a few people in the courtyard, some sitting at a table near the building, while others are standing or walking. The ground is paved with cobblestones, and there are trees with green leaves providing shade. The sky is clear and bright blue, creating a peaceful and pleasant atmosphere." />

<img src="/assets/20250510-bergen7.jpg" alt="A group of people inside a historical wooden room with bright orange walls, wooden beam ceiling, and stone floor. Long wooden tables and benches line the room. Two ornate chandeliers hang from the ceiling. A woman in a red dress is standing by an old wooden cabinet, gesturing as she speaks to the group seated on benches along the wall. Sunlight streams through multiple-paned windows, casting patterns on the tables and floor, creating a warm, inviting atmosphere." />

<img src="/assets/20250510-bergen8.jpg" alt="Interior of a historic kitchen or hearth room with dark wooden walls and stone floors. Several black iron pots hang from metal hooks attached to a heavy wooden beam suspended by chains. In the background is a large whitewashed brick fireplace with a tall chimney and arched openings. Warm light filters through small windows and open doors, illuminating parts of the room. Lanterns hang from the walls, contributing to the rustic, old-world atmosphere." />

<img src="/assets/20250510-bergen10.jpg" alt="Narrow wooden alley lined with historic wooden buildings in the Bryggen area of Bergen, Norway, a UNESCO World Heritage site. The buildings have colorful facades in shades of brown, gray, and yellow, with overhanging upper stories and small windows. The alley is made of wooden planks, and the structures lean slightly inward, creating a cozy, old-world atmosphere. A few shop signs and decorations are visible, and the passage extends into the distance, ending in a brighter open area." />

After the tour I wandered around the museum some on my own, after which I strolled over to the top of the harbour where they have a bunch of outside stalls selling mostly seafood (raw and prepared). I enjoyed this very fresh salmon sandwich and people-watched:

On the table is a silver tray holding a burger with lettuce, a patty, sprouts, and pickled onions. Beside it is a glass, a fork with a napkin, and a bottle of Coca-Cola. The restaurant area is under a red canopy with string lights, and outside, people are walking along the harbor with colorful historic buildings and a green hillside in the background under a clear blue sky." />

The rest of the afternoon I wandered aimlessly. I did have to stop in an "apothecary" for some flossers and took a momment to check out the sunscreen prices. These are about $40 US, so I'd advise bringing your own.

<img src="/assets/20250510-sunscreen.jpg" alt="Several tubes of Cliniderm Caring Protection Sun Lotion SPF 25 are displayed on a store shelf. The white tubes have a simple design with the brand name and a circular logo at the top, an orange circle indicating Big Size, and text highlighting medium protection with UVA and UVB coverage. A shelf label below shows a 30% discount when buying two or more, with the price listed as 419.90 Norwegian kroner." />

For dinner I opted for another bento box, this one from a place at the main train station.

<img src="/assets/20250510-bento.jpg" alt="The image shows a Japanese-style bento box containing a variety of foods. The box is divided into five compartments: 1. Top left: Slices of white fish sashimi placed on shredded daikon radish 2. Top right: Two grilled meat skewers topped with sesame seeds, served over a mixed salad containing edamame beans, cherry tomatoes, radish slices, and pink pickled vegetables. 3. Bottom left: Four pieces of sushi rolls filled with salmon and avocado, next to a row of peeled shrimp. Also included are a portion of seaweed salad, a small pile of pickled ginger, and a dollop of wasabi. 4. Bottom right: Pieces of tempura, possibly shrimp or vegetables, topped with a creamy sauce and a drizzle of sweet sauce. The meal is neatly arranged and colorful, offering a combination of raw, cooked, and fried elements typical of a Japanese bento." />

With a 7:50am express ferry in the morning, I call it an early night.

[^1]: My understanding is this tour accomodates up to 25 people and can sell out in the summer.
