I start the day after a **huge** sleep, logging almost 9 hours on the CPAP. One would like to believe my jet lag has been remedied and my internal clock has been reset.

A few days before the trip I intentionally booked a walking tour for this first full day in Bergen, to get me up and moving earlier than perhaps my body wanted to. I skipped hotel breakfast and casually made my way over to the Bryggens Museum next to the waterfront for my scheduled appointment. 

Our group for the tour was unique. There were only six of us[^1], and the other five people were all together -- an older, blind couple; their two guides; and one other person with them. I ended up speaking with the couple quite a bit once they learned I was American and interested in Norway and its history, as they were both Norwegian. 

The tour itself was fascinating! Not to spoil it for you but: there were lots of fires. I mean, they built with wood and all. Each time there was a fire, they built a little bit closer to the water. And, as you might imagine, they took lots of precautions to avoid future fires. 


[^1]: My understanding is this tour accomodates up to 25 people and can sell out in the summer.
