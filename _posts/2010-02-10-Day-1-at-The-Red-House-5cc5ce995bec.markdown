Everything’s here. The garage is full, there are boxes _everywhere_, but:

*   The baby’s room is all set up, including crib, change table, white noise generator, and baby monitors
*   Kitchen is usable. Spices are unpacked, pots & pans are accessible.
*   Wine is accessible.
*   Our bed is set up and made. We can sleep.
*   We have access to the Internets.
*   TiVo HD is online and ready for action. No shows will be missed.

Tomorrow I spend a lot of time building out my office, including a probable scouting trip to Ikea for an extension piece to my Galant desk and some bookshelves. Perhaps meatballs & mash, too.

p.s. My employer’s office will be closed tomorrow because of 18" of snow predicted. Ha ha.
