I'm grateful to Past Brian for not booking an early flight. Today's first flight is at 10:25am, a perfectly reasonable time for reasonable people. This means we had a chance to get up at a decent hour and not be rushed. The extra time was helpful, as the people in front of us to check bags had three each, of varying weights that needed to be redistributed between them. It would not have occurred to me to buy floor tile in Europe and then fly back to the States with it in my checked bag, but it did occur to the people in front of us.

Once on the other side of security, I had a chance to tuck into the latest issue of Business Punk.

The flight was fine:

Including this legend a few seats up who fired up Ferris Bueller within 3 minutes of boarding.

Our layover was in Detroit airport. Rowan's Global Entry wasn't working at the kiosk and he had to get another photo made at the booth, but it didn't cost us any time. Of note was that we had to claim our bags and then walk them across to the next room to recheck them. They made multiple announcements on the plane and there are lots of signs about it. Still, I wonder how many people are on autopilot. 

Our Detroit to Raleigh-Durham flight went off without a hitch and then we were back to our friendly local airport, RDU!
