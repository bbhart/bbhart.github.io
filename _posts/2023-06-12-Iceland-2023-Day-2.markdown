- **Start of day:** Laugarvatn, Iceland
- **End of day:** Laugarvatn, Iceland

I kind of slept from midnight to 8am or so and wake up Woke up feeling hungover, without the [boozing](https://www.youtube.com/shorts/N-LXDzgukOg). All day I tried to push through with a wicked headache and neck aches that my usual ibuprofen dose couldn't cut through. It took all the way until 9pm to start to feel somewhat normal, so this was kind of a lost day as far as feeling good.

I sat in the greenhouse, where I researched CPAP supplies and had a short doze. The weather ended up being better than forecast. In the early afternoon it was sunny and partly cloudy, temps in the high 50's, with less wind than yesterday. This is very good Iceland weather.

## The mysterious door lock

The door lock for our Airbnb had me stumped. In the US we don't typically include the door handle as part of the locking mechanism. Well, this is not the case in the countries I've visited in Europe. This door is strange in that you twist the knob down to bolt it, then turn the key. Nowhere is this obvious, but then once you know, you know. It took us about 5 mins to figure this out as we were trying to leave.

## The shower situation

Here's our shower. There is no shower indoors at this rental. This ends up not being a problem, actually, because 1) water is hot (VERY HOT) and instant, and 2) there aren't neighbors within sight.

## Attempting to find Brúarfoss

We set out mid-day to try to find [Brúarfoss](https://www.earthtrekkers.com/how-to-visit-bruarfoss-waterfall/) but couldn't find where you turn in, so went to [Geysir](https://www.south.is/en/place/geysir-geothermal-area) instead. We found a good charger there and managed to get the Tesla up to 98% charge, which should eliminate range anxiety for a few days. The visitors center was busy and touristy (and smelled like fish). We walked around the geysirs area -- there's one 'main' one where everyone stands around videoing themselves for 10-15 minutes until it finally goes off, plus a few smaller ones that don't 'geysir'. There's a hike up a hill here that might be worth trying but we weren't equipped for it… I had my 'hangover' and one of the kids wasn't into it.

## Finding Brúarfoss (finally)

I did more research and this time we were able to find Brúarfoss… turns out the access road is like 600 meters from the road to our cottage. Oops. We went over there, did a bit of hiking around, and got some great images.

From there, drove to Laugarvatn to hit up a small market for butter, spaghetti, jam, and other snack type things. After dropping groceries we went back to [Efstidalur II](https://efstidalur.is/) for an early dinner, where 3 of us ordered meatballs + fries, and Sherri had the cheeseburger. Meatballs were ok (kids didn't like the sauce) and the fries had cayenne on them, so overall the meal could've been better in their opinion. I liked it.

The kids bounced some after dinner...

... then we came back to the cottage. 

As I mentioned yesterday, I forgot a critical piece for my CPAP machine. First time for everything, I suppose, I just wish it wasn't when traveling internationally for two weeks. I tried to reach out to several pharmacies but I'll make a long story short and say I didn't have any luck. Let's throw obstructive sleep apnea on top of jet lag and endless days where the sun never sets! 

Oh, and we figured out why the rental Tesla's trunk was having problems closing. Quite the genius design by Tesla.
