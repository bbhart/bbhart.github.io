This morning I woke up at 6am, beating my alarm clock by 45 minutes, after a night of broken sleep. This is the day I move from Bergen to Balestrand, still in Norway. 

There were two departure options for the express ferry: 8:00am or 4:30pm. I waffled a lot on which one to take, weighing pros and cons of spending another day in Bergen vs being on my way. I felt I'd seen what I wanted to see in Bergen and was ready to experience small town Norway, so 8:00am was decided.

The hotel reception desk wasn't open yet so I left my key next to their keyboard and grabbed an Uber. I'd debated hoofing the 1.3km from hotel to ferry terminal with my luggage but instead opted for an (expensive) Uber instead. 

The [ferry website](https://www.norled.no/en/express-boat-ferry/) is a little tricky to use but I was able to book the ticket the night before. We boarded at 7:35am and left promptly at 8:00am. I don't think I realized how very "express" the express ferry was. Once we're out of the Bergen harbor, they gun it. Per my GPS we were hauling it at 37mph through these fjords, slowing for the ocassional no wake zones. If their paperwork didn't show anyone with a certain town as a stop, and there wasn't anybody waiting shoreside, they skipped the stop. We made perfect time to Balestrand.

There's no way for me to adequately describe how amazing the trip was. Even my videos won't do it justice. Thirty minutes in and I'm thinking to myself "This might be the best $100 I've ever spent."

One note for future travelers: when you're nearing the stop, be sure you're ready to leave! This means fetching your bag from the aft storage and making your way to the front of the ferry. They aren't wasting a lot of time at each stop! Unfortunately I got stuck behind someone whose approach to problem-solving was to stand in the aisle and hope that everything worked out. Regardless, I made it off, barely, and made the 100m walk to the [Hotel Kviknes](https://www.kviknes.no/), my home for the next two nights. 

There are two sections to the Kviknes: the historic part, with 25 rooms, and the modern (1960's) part with 165 rooms. I'm in the modern part, with the main reason being I have a balcony. It is not an attractive building, though, and is at odds with its surroundings. Frankly, it looks like one of the budget accomodations you'd find somewhere like Daytona Beach. But the room itself is nice, the view from the balcony is undeniable, and the staff is friendly and eager. I relax in my room for a bit, then set out around 2pm for some lunch.

I don't have to go far. I find [Pearl by Harbor](https://www.instagram.com/pearl_by_harbor/) just outside the hotel. The grilled salmon, mashed potatoes, and grilled vegetables with teriyaki sauce exceeds all expectations! 

The late lunch and jet lag hit me hard in the afternoon and I find myself alternating between reading and napping. 

Around 8pm I rally and head out for dinner. There are several closeby choices. I select [Baalee Restaurant](https://g.co/kgs/mQVZHDW), a family restaurant an easy three minute walk from the hotel, based on positive reviews and a few tantalizing photos of the shrimp scampi. Of course I order that, and it doesn't disappoint! 

The month, coupled with Balestrand's 61 degree northern latitude, means at 9pm there is still ample daylight for a walk. 

My original plan for Balestrand was to do a nice, challenging hike, but I'm rethinking that based on how my left shin is feeling. I did a [walk down from Fl√∏yen in Bergen](https://www.alltrails.com/explore/recording/evening-hike-at-floyen-via-floysvingene-d010396) -- around 1,000 feet of vertical descend -- two days ago, and my leg is still feeling it some. If I don't do that then I'm not sure _what_ I'll do. Balestrand being so small is both a bug and a feature.
