What a difference a good night's sleep makes! Sans seagulls and with conditioned air I slept like a baby who sleeps through the night. 

Today's plan was to visit Hangurstoppen, the summit of the mountain adjacent to Voss that the gondola runs to. I considered hiking up to the top and taking the gondola back down, but at 2,000ft of vertical ascent I just didn't have it in me. I'm pretty sure I could do a 2,000ft hike at this point, just not after doing 1,500ft two days before. I'm not there yet. 

I took the gondola up around 11:30am with the plan to wander around the top a bit and then grab a burger at the restaurant at the summit. The gondola ticket was ~$18 each way. Once I reached the top I attempted to hike the ~1km panoramic trail but it was poorly marked and I gave up about a quarter in. Nothing lost; the views were will outstanding, with our without panoramic trail.

I'd skipped breakfast in anticipation of a fulling burger and fries at the top. The restaurant had other plans, however, and were offering a (very) limited menu of choices like tomato soup, hummus, tzatziki, or shrimp salad. Basically nothing that involves grilling or frying, it seems. I opted for the shrimp salad, and I wanted to be mad, but it ended up being really tasty. Not filling like a burger, but tasty.

After lunch I wandered the summit a bit more then boarded a gondola back down to the hotel. I used the bathroom and headed right back out for the 3 mile easy hike I'd flagged prior to coming: [Bordalsgjelet Gorge](https://www.alltrails.com/trail/norway/vestland/bordalsgjelet). Most of this hike is on roads and trails (though it's not on _flat_ roads), with the last little bit being a rocky carved-out trail along a narrow gorge. I was glad for my hiking boots and strong legs for the last little bit. The wet, slanted rocks keep you on your toes, though there's a handrail to keep anything serious from befalling you. I got a little lost on the way to the gorge and otherwise had to pay close attention to my map app, but the way back once I knew where to go was sublime. I was able to be more in the moment. The sun had arrived, it was a comfortable 55F or so, and my stress and anxiety had melted away for the moment.

Once back at the hotel I headed up to the part of the hotel where they have a bunch of tables and chairs set up outside (sun deck?) and read my Kindle for a few hours in the sun. Later in the evening I walked across town to the steak place I'd had my eye on the night before and had a medium-rare-that-was-actually-rare tenderloin (it was still really good), asparagus, broccoli, mushrooms, and an au gratin potato concoction in a French onion soup bowl that I'll definitely have to try to recreate at home. 

Tomorrow my day doesn't start until checkout time at the hotel. I'm on a 1:03pm train to Oslo that arrives at 7:05pm. I made sure to pre-book a seat on the right (and correct) side of the train to ensure the best views, and I've charged my GoPro in preparation. With my schedule change of taking the ferry to Copenhagen a day early, I'll be squeezed for time in Oslo. I'll probably be settled into my hotel by 8pm and then the ferry starts boarding at 3:30pm the next day. I'll see how much power touring I can do!
