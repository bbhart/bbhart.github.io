What a difference a good night's sleep makes! With conditioned air and without the company of seagulls I slept like a baby who sleeps through the night. 

Today's plan was to visit the summit of the mountain adjacent to Voss, have lunch at [Hangurstoppen](https://www.vossresort.no/en/restaurants/hangurstoppen-restaurant), and head back down. I considered hiking up to the top and taking the gondola back down, but at 2,000ft of vertical ascent I just didn't have it in me. I'm pretty sure I could do a 2,000ft hike at this point, just not after doing 1,500ft two days before. I'm not there yet. 

I took the gondola up around 11:30am with the plan to wander around the top a bit and then grab a burger at the restaurant at the summit. The gondola ticket was ~$18 each way.

It is suspended from a large mechanical arm connected to a concrete structure above. On the front of the cabin, white text reads 'Kårdaløenuten 1295 moh', indicating an elevation of 1295 meters above sea level. The cabin is part of the Leitner gondola system, as seen from the logo. The station is an enclosed building with metal and wooden support beams and large windows allowing natural light inside. A yellow arrow on the ground points forward, guiding foot traffic. Some equipment or supplies wrapped in tarps are visible in the background." />

Once I reached the top I attempted to hike the ~1km panoramic trail but it was poorly marked and I gave up about a quarter in. Nothing lost; the views were will outstanding, with or without panoramic trail.

<img src="/assets/20250514-top1.jpg" alt="The image shows a small, dark-colored wooden cabin with a hexagonal shape, situated in a natural, open area in Voss, Norway. The cabin has a shingled roof with a central chimney and a front door featuring a geometric window design. It sits on a raised wooden platform with a ramp or walkway leading up to it. In front of the cabin, there is a wooden box or container and a tilted panel, possibly used for seating or storage. The surrounding landscape consists of grassy and rocky terrain with patches of moss and sparse vegetation. In the distance, snow-capped mountains and a line of evergreen trees are visible under a mostly cloudy sky." />

<img src="/assets/20250514-top2.jpg" alt="The image shows a large swing positioned at the edge of a hill or mountain, overlooking a scenic valley in the Voss, Norway area. The swing consists of a sturdy rectangular wooden or metal seat suspended by two metal chains from a tall brown frame. The ground around the swing is gravel with some exposed stone and wooden borders outlining the swing's base. In the background, a wide view of the valley stretches out, featuring green fields, forested hills, a river, and clusters of buildings. Snow-capped mountains rise in the distance under a lightly overcast sky. The scene conveys a sense of height and openness with a dramatic natural backdrop." />

I'd skipped breakfast in anticipation of a filling burger and fries at the top. The restaurant had other plans, however, and were offering a (very) limited menu of choices like tomato soup, hummus, tzatziki, or shrimp salad. Basically nothing that involves grilling or frying, it seems. I opted for the shrimp salad, and I wanted to be mad, but it ended up being really tasty. Not filling like a burger, but tasty.

The foreground features a wooden table with a clear glass, a closed blue fabric-covered Kindle (now lost somewhere in Norway R.I.P.), and a glass bottle of Coca-Cola. The background reveals a high-ceilinged, two-level space with contemporary design elements. There are brown leather chairs around dark tables, wooden cabinetry, and a staircase leading to an upper mezzanine area with additional seating. The lighting is a mix of hanging pendant lamps and natural light from large windows on the left side. Several people are seated at tables, and a counter area on the right appears to serve food and drinks. The atmosphere is casual and modern." />

After lunch I wandered the summit a bit more then boarded a gondola back down to the hotel. I freshened up a bit and headed right back out for the 3 mile easy hike I'd flagged prior to coming: [Bordalsgjelet Gorge](https://www.alltrails.com/trail/norway/vestland/bordalsgjelet). Most of this hike is on roads and trails (though it's not on _flat_ roads).

<img src="/assets/20250514-hike1.jpg" alt="The image shows a wide, straight gravel path running through a peaceful forested area in the Voss, Norway region. Tall pine trees with slender trunks and sparse branches line both sides of the path, creating a lightly shaded canopy. The forest floor is covered with green grass and low vegetation, and sunlight filters through the trees, casting soft shadows on the path. A few utility poles with small devices attached are visible along the right side of the trail. The path appears well-maintained and stretches far into the distance, suggesting it's a popular route for walking or cycling." />

<img src="/assets/20250514-hike2.jpg" alt="The image shows a covered pedestrian bridge crossing the Vosso river in Voss, Norway. The bridge is constructed with wooden slats on the sides and roof, supported by a rust-colored metal frame. Light filters through the slats, creating sharp diagonal shadows on the wooden planks and central metal grate of the walkway. The bridge is long and straight, with a strong sense of depth leading to a distant opening at the far end. On the right, beyond the bridge structure, there are glimpses of the river and a hillside dotted with houses and trees. The design combines functionality with a visually striking pattern of light and shadow." />


The last little bit being a rocky carved-out trail along a narrow gorge, so I was thankful for my hiking boots and strong legs. The wet, slanted rocks keep you on your toes, though there's a handrail to keep anything serious from happening. 

<img src="/assets/20250514-hike3.jpg" alt="The image shows a section of the hiking trail at Bordalsgjelet Gorge in Voss, Norway. The narrow, rocky path ascends a slope and features a series of rustic wooden steps made from small logs. These steps are supported by a wooden handrail running along the right side. In the foreground, a sturdy metal railing marks the edge of the trail near the entrance or a viewpoint. The surrounding landscape is lush, with moss-covered rocks, green vegetation, and tall, slender trees with early spring leaves. The scene captures the natural beauty and rugged terrain typical of the gorge area." />

I got a little lost on the way to the gorge and otherwise had to pay close attention to my map app, but the way back once I knew where to go was sublime. I was able to be more in the moment. The sun had arrived, it was a comfortable 55F or so, and my stress and anxiety had melted away for the moment.

Once back at the hotel I headed up to the part of the hotel where they have a bunch of tables and chairs set up outside (sun deck?) and read my Kindle for a few hours in the sun. Later in the evening I walked across town to the [steak place I'd had my eye on the night before](https://www.facebook.com/Vossevangengrill) and had a medium-rare-that-was-actually-rare tenderloin (it was still really good), asparagus, broccoli, mushrooms, and an au gratin potato concoction in a French onion soup bowl that I'll definitely have to try to recreate at home. 

<img src="/assets/20250514-steak1.jpg" alt="The image shows a restaurant menu page for steaks and ribs, featuring items in both Norwegian and English. It includes tenderloin steaks, a house special called Vossevangen Westernbiff, and BBQ spare ribs. The menu highlights optional sauces, side dishes, and portion upgrades, with prices listed in Norwegian kroner. The layout is clear, with descriptions beneath each item and a mix of bold text and color highlights for emphasis." />

The main plate includes a tenderloin steak with creamy pepper sauce, accompanied by grilled tomato with cheese, corn on the cob, asparagus, broccoli, and sautéed mushrooms. A separate dish contains a portion of gratinated potatoes. On the table are a water pitcher, a glass of water, and a lit candle in a glass holder, suggesting a casual but nicely set dining environment." />

Tomorrow my day doesn't start until checkout time at the hotel. I'm on a 1:03pm train to Oslo that arrives at 7:05pm. I made sure to pre-book a seat on the right (and correct) side of the train to ensure the best views, and I've charged my GoPro in preparation. With my schedule change of taking the ferry to Copenhagen a day early, I'll be squeezed for time in Oslo. I'll probably be settled into my hotel by 8pm and then the ferry starts boarding at 2:30pm the next day. I'll see how much power touring I can do!
