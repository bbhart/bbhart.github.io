## Lava tube adventure

We left for the lava tube around 12:10. Amazing cave tour! Lots of photos. Rowan liked it especially.

After lava tube we came over to the Hùsafell Hotel bistro place -- 3 of us split a meat lovers pizza and Siena had tempura shrimp. Back to the cottage for awhile, and then we tried to find some hiking trails.

## The trails that couldn't be found

There are elaborate hiking trail maps but goddamn if we couldn't find any of them. We really tried. They have printed maps, we asked a staff members, we scoped it out with the car. We could. Not. Find. Them. So we proceeded on to Hraunfossar Waterfall, which is just a few minutes away. Spent about 30 mins there. Back home for pork chops on the filthy grill, which I left much cleaner than I found it.

Another trip to the jump pillow at 10:30pm because why not it doesn't get dark here, and now back at the cottage for the night.
