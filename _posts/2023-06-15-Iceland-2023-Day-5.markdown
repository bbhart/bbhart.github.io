## Lava tube adventure

We left for the lava tube around 12:10. Amazing cave tour! Lots of photos. Rowan liked it especially.

After lava tube we came over to the Hùsafell Hotel bistro place -- 3 of us split a meat lovers pizza and Siena had tempura shrimp.

We relaxed back at the cottage for awhile, and set out to try to find some hiking trails which were supposed to start on property.

## The trails that couldn't be found

There are elaborate hiking trail maps but we couldn't find any of them. We really tried. They have printed maps, we asked a staff members, we scoped it out with the car. We could. Not. Find. Them.

We bailed on that, grabbed the car, and headed to [Hraunfossar Waterfall](https://guidetoiceland.is/travel-iceland/drive/hraunfossar), which is just a few minutes away.

We spent about 30 mins there. Back "home", we cooked pork chops on the filthy grill (which I left much cleaner than I found it), and combined with potatoes and a veggie for a decent home-cooked meal... at a fraction of the price of eating out. 

Later, the kids made another trip to the jump pillow at 10:30pm because why not, it doesn't get dark here, and then back at the cottage for the night.
