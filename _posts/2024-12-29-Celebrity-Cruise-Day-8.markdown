Sea day travelling between Bonaire and San Juan, Puerto Rico. Not much to write about.

Their croissants onboard are really good.

Room with a view.

The first half of the cruise was fairly smooth but here heading toward Puerto Rico we're feeling a lot more motion. Not enough to make things uncomfortable.

Tomorrow: San Juan, Puerto Rico!
