Sea day between NYC and Halifax. Nothing notable to report for today. It was foggy pretty much all day long, getting denser as the day progressed. The kids are, of course, racing around the ship and playing elevator tag.

Mid-afternoon the ship started sounding the horn every minute or so. Like I said: dense fog. It made for some cool photos in the evening, which were the only photos I ended up taking today. We've been missing out on a lot of pool tanning, though.
