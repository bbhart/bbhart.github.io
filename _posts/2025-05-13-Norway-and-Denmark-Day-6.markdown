Let me share something about where I'm staying. It has the **loudest** seagulls I've ever heard anywhere. I don't know if it's all around Balestrand, all around Norway, or maybe they've been hanging out at this hotel for generations upon generations. There's a group of them and every now and then they'll get real chatty, and its ear-piercing in a way our usual beach seagulls aren't.

Hotels with air conditioning aren't big in Norway, and my hotel (which is no budget hotel) is no exception. That means my options in the evening are to either leave my patio door open and get some fresh air, or bake under the heavy duvet all night. I opted for the open door. And here's where the birds enter the picture. All through the night they'd periodically have their loud, cawing conversations. Did I mention their calls are uniquely ear-piercing? 

Long story short, I'm now on back-to-back nights of broken sleep.

Today is transfer day, where I make my way from Balestrand to Voss. See yesterday's post for some of the planning that went into today. The tl;dr is I settled on a plan to take a 20 minute express ferry from Balestrand to Vik at 7:50am, wait there (somewhere) for 50 minutes, then catch bus 810 at 9am to Voss (Vossevangen), a ride of about an hour and a half. 

The ferry was easy. Once I made it to Vik, though, I discovered a problem. There really wasn't anywhere to hang out. I walk up the main street a bit. It's a small town to begin with, and it was still too early for the restaurants to open. The Coop market was open, but that wouldn't work. To kill time I walk back down to the pier to stare at the water. Then, I look back at the road, and happen to see bus 810 rounding the corner towards the bus stop. It's 30 minutes early! The hell? I fast-walk back to the stop with my luggage and check in with the bus driver. He confirms, yes, this is the bus to Voss. But it doesn't go there yet. It goes down to Vangsnes (around 15 mins away), stops there, then comes back to Vik. Vangsnes is the terminus for two car ferry services. Since it's chilly out, I ask if he'd mind if I ride along? No problem, he says, and I load my luggage into the storage area[^1] and take a seat on the empty bus.

Thirty minutes later we're back where we started, and in the meantime I was treated to an essentially free fjords tour. We then depart Vik for Voss. I don't know what I expected, but I was completely floored by the middle part of this trip. It was still a winter wonderland, not a small amount of snow still on the ground. It felt like we had diverted to central Iceland, in the winter. I'll share the videos. 

I made it safely to the Scandic Voss hotel, thanked the driver, and lucked into an early room again -- at 10:45am! It wasn't free this time but I think the price was something like $20 to check in more than 5 hours early. I was so thankful to be able to get into the room; as jaw-dropping as the bus ride was, I was fighting the sleep headnods, and may have even dozed for a few minutes. 

The gray, overcast weather matched my mood. I wandered out to try to find a late lunch. I walked from one end of town to the other, peeking at menus, but not being interested in anything I saw. I ended up with a pretty mediocre tomato-basil-mozarella from the gas station across from the hotel, which I ate in the room. 

I whittled away the afternoon in my room, then headed back out around 6. I ended up at [Vossa Sushi](https://vossasushi.no/), a small place on the other end of town that mainly caters to takeout customers but has three 2-tops for eat-ins. I ate in. The 4.9 rating on Google seems justified. The pricing was... interesting. Shrimp tempura app was $15. A 5 piece chicken gyoza was $18. A miso soup was $9. Nigiri, on the other hand, was right on par with what you'd pay in the States, maybe even a little cheaper. Go figure. I stuck with the fish.

After dinner the sun was out and chill gone, so I had a nice walk down by the lake. Tonight I'll try to sleep early. And this time, no seagulls!


[^1]: these inter-city buses in Norway, operated by Skyss, are proper charter buses like you'd have if you were going on a tour. Nice!
