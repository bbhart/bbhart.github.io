Here's how **this** day started. Welcome to Keflavik, Iceland! Looking good, Billy Ray!

It's one of those situations where the bus picks you up at your plane and ferries you to the terminal, which is never fun. In our case they waited until the bus was completely full and then waited another 5 minutes until it was overflowing. Incredible service. Through passport control and collected another stamp:

The Icelandic weather outside was wild, oscillating between snow storms one minute and bright and sunny the next.

I spend a little time on the world's most uncomfortable benches:

After close to 4 hours I board my flight for Bergen. This is my meal, which was surprisingly good. The dish on the left is just melted cheese, which I don't mind at all.

The light rail from Bergen airport to my stop, called Nonneseter, takes around 45 minutes, after which I have an 800m or so walk (the last 200m very uphill) to my hotel. This was the first of several hotels which would end up being cool about me checking in early.

The room is small but serviceable, a theme that would persist (by design) through the trip.

Instead of succumbing to my jet lag, I decide to go to the top of a nearby mountain. The base of the Fløibanen funicular is right in downtown Bergen, an easy 20 walk from the hotel. I buy a one-way ticket, intending to walk down from the top.

The hike down Fløyen is beautiful, and no photo I'm able to take captures it well.

It's around 300m of downhill, which my legs are not calibrated for. I do it, but the front of my quads and my shins are feeling it. Meanwhile, I had at least one guy jog past me going up and then pass me going back down, and multiple other hikers and runners going uphill dressed for a casual walk. Mountain people are built different.

I ended the day with some thin-noodles pad Thai near the hotel:
