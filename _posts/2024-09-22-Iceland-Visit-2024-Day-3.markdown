Documenting **August 18, 2024**.

Today we're on the South Coast of Iceland and in Reykjavik proper.

Sherri's feeling better. Besides a lot of sneezing and runny nose, which is possibly allergies, Siena seems untouched by our illness. Rowan still has the crud and isn't well enough to get out and about. 

We left the Airbnb right at 11 and made our way 30 minutes to the Lava Center from the other day to Supercharge next door. While charging Siena *finally* had a chance to bounce on one of the [bounce pillows](https://talladventurefam.com/bounce-pillow/) that seem to be the rage here. We drove another 90 minutes or so to Reykjavik and again had to charge to be able to return the car nearly full. It's the [same Supercharger as last year](https://maps.app.goo.gl/RHRBRR6GmEQKHR119) and, once again, we managed a spot *just* in time to avoid having to wait. We grabbed the last spot and then someone else rolled up a minute later and had to wait 15 mins.

We stayed in the same set of rental units in Reykjavik as last year, just a different unit. They do a not-great job with the check-in instructions -- having numbers or labels on doors would be great -- but otherwise these are reliable rentals in a great spot.

I hefted our four suitcases up the narrow, twisting staircase, then set off to return the rental car over by the domestic airport and walk back. 

It's a sunny 51 here. Sherri has recovered enough to be able to go for a longer walk with me. We walked downhill to the [The Sun Voyager scuplture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Sun_Voyager), then west down the waterfront toward City Hall and that center section of Reykjavik we hadn't explored the year before.

Later we walked over to BÃ³nus grocery store and picked out some dinner items. We came back and I made baked pork chops, skilled potatoes, and peas + carrots. 

I tried to capture the sunset but was out of position:

Tomorrow: home!
