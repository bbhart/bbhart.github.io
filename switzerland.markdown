I've visited Switzerland three times now. 

2019 trip
=========

This was my first visit to Switzerland. Of my three trips, this one was the most unplanned (least planned?), meaning I arrived with a return ticket and lodging for the first two nights, then nothing beyond that. I'd make most of it up as I went along, which has its benefits and drawbacks.

2023 trip
=========

I took this trip with my father in July and August of 2023. The itinerary was:

* Fly into Geneva and spend a few nights.
* Take the train from Geneva to Montreux. 
* Take the Goldenpass Express from Montreux to Interlaken.
* Transfer from Interlaken (Ost) to Lauterbrunnen then Wengen.
* Spend two evenings at the lovely Hotel Alpenrose in Wengen.
* Hike Mannlichen to Kleine Scheidegg.
* Take the train from Wengen to Freiburg im Breisgau, Germany.
* Spend three evenings at the Courtyard in Freiburg im Breisgau.
* Visit Strasbourg in France as a day trip while staying in Freiburg.
* Take the train from Freiburg to Basel, Switzerland.
* Spend two evenings at the Hotel Märthof in Basel.
* Take the train from Basel to Luzern.
* Spend two evenings Hotel Drei Könige in Luzern.
* Visit and hike around Mount Pilatus near Luzern. Visit Festung Fürigen bunker.
* Take the train from Luzern to Venice.
* Spend three evenings at Aqua Palace Venice.
* Take a private water taxi from our hotel to Venice Marco Polo Airport.

Unfortunately I did not journal this trip, though I have many photos I may share at some point.

2024 trip
=========

This trip took place entirely within Switzerland, and I went solo. Fortunately I spent time journaling my journey. 

About halfway through my journaling I started making a conscious effort to capture not only what I was doing, but how I was feeling -- my mental state as a solo traveller. I don't think I did a good job here. I hope to do more of this introspection in the future. Solo travel can be taxing, especially when you're around people who are surrounded by _their_ friends and family.
