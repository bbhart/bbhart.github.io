Brian Hart currently lives in Holly Springs NC. He's previously 
spent time in Sunnyvale CA, Celebration FL, Downingtown PA, 
Orlando FL, and Tampa FL. There was a year in Miami South Beach but 
that's hardly worth mentioning.

His last job was as a Head of Engineering at [GlossGenius](https://glossgenius.com), an app
you should definitely get if you run a hair/nail/beauty salon. Prior to that he held
engineering roles at LinkedIn, Jaunt VR, BT (British Telecom), Royal Caribbean, and Disney.

He's blessed with a wife of 18+ years and two teenage children.
